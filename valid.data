__label__non_toxic mlb.com images \n\nHi Nishkid.  I saw you RfA listing and began looking through your contributions when I noticed that you've uploaded about 100 player portraits from mlb.com, tagging them as . One problem is that none of them contain fair use rationales. The more important problem is that they do not meet criterion #1 of WP:FUC. As these players are living, and especially because they are active and perform in public 162 times a year, there is ample opportunity for contributors to take their own photographs and release them under free licenses.  We need images like that, that like their articles' text, can be used anywhere, by anyone. The problem with using these photographs, even in the short term, and even if they are intended for publicity purposes (and I'm not certain these are), is that it greatly hurts our chances of acquiring the free alternatives. Best of luck on your RfA. ×

__label__non_toxic Sorry you are way wrong on this one.  Here is the MSP test results from 2008:\n\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/documents/msp/Acceleration-MSP_VehicleEval08_Web_221472_7.pdf\n\nThe CVPI averaged 8.25s in 0-60 runs, 16.35 1/4 mile and has a top speed of 129 MPH.   I like the CVPI, and I have more miles behind the wheel of them than any other car.  But they are have no bottom end power (only 287 ft-lbs, vs LT1 330), an LT1 can easily eat a brand new 250HP CVPI.  The Caprices ran about 16.0 flat, and averaged around 140 MPH top speed.  However, Most magazines ran low 15 seconds with Impala SS's, and if you go to the track, most LT1's run low 15's stock with ease.  \n\nLike I said, in the Police Fleet Magazine I have, there is Ford Dealer that specifically sells brand new modded CVPI's that are designed to run the SAME as a LT1 Caprice.  In the article it does a number of upgrades to the car (exhaust, gears, air intake), and at the end it runs the SAME quarter mile and SAME 0-100 as the LT1 Caprice three year average from MSP.  \n\nI agree the CVPI has come a long way in the past few years (especially steering and suspension).  It is probably one of the best all round police cars ever (in my opinion), but the LTI is still a faster car.  And now you are showing your Ford bias, whereas I am trying to be impartial.

Let's be frank: if Messianic Jews called themselves Christians then there would be no problem, but if they don't then we are essentially engaging in a form of prejudice if we force the term on them.  If you were Catholic, would you like some Protestant insisting that you're not a Christian?  If you're protestant, would you like some Catholic asserting that you are a heretic?  These are not people who are trying to give up their Jewish heritage and become Christians (which would be tremendously easy to do, simply by converting); these are people who want to accept Christ while reaffirming their Jewishness.

__label__non_toxic Hi Neuromancer,\n\nYou will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nFirst, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.\n\nSecond, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:\n\n""During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.""\n\n""Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. \nOn May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.\nOn May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border."" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])\n\nThe SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.\n\nThe biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: ""It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave"". 'It appeared that"" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.\n\nNow lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  "

If Prince William predesease his father, the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc.\neg:- George V 's third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry, The Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden. his heirs(first Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children, as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster. But Present Duke, prince Richards children don't have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden.  \n\nWhen the child has been born, assuming we don't know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge? This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge#Pregnancy (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online \nNo, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge, i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge. The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Prince(ss) X of Cambridge. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won't become less accurate or less precise once the childis born.   \n\nThe child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of Cambridge or Princess (Name) of Cambridge. So probably not.  (Want to have a chat?) \nPrince(ss) NN of Cambridge would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there's no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium, the article Princess NN of Sweden/Belgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless.   \nPersonally, I think Norman is a great name for a Prince, although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it.  \nI agree with Morhange. Additionally, we might not be certain as to the child's precise style until one is used (styles have broken precedent before, remember!), so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG... BD \n\nThe style of the boy is given as ""His Royal Highness Prince [name] of Cambridge"" on the official webpages of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - so speculation about that can now end... (www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/the-duchess-of-cambridge-has-been-delivered-of-son)\n\nSince this article is locked, can someone correct, ""as was the case for his father who was n

__label__non_toxic Hi! Well, regarding the headings, having headings for one-sentence paragraphs is rather redundant. As for the deleted info, it is not encyclopaedic. Wikipedia aims to include all human knowledge, but there is a limit to what is notable and what not. How does this info further our knowledge of the tribe? It doesn't. It is only tangentially related, and with zero historical significance. It might belong in an article on this Nikodemos, if there were more info about him, or in an article on embezzlement and law in ancient Attica, but here it was simply a bit of trivia.    ✍

One of the reasons why I hate having pages I created deleted (especially the ""speedy-deletion"" thing that appears almost automatically seconds after a page has been created) is this: most of those page can be improved through time.

__label__non_toxic Sorry about my revert blanking the paragraph you added. It was inadvertent.

I think some of the pro-pollard rhetoric needs to be trimmed, and the 'Directors response' states certain things that aren't reflected elsewhere in the article.
__label__non_toxic Hi, the edits you made were reverted as there was no explanation for their removal.

__label__non_toxic Bard Of Ely\nHi there,\nI just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.\n\nCheers,

__label__non_toxic This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading, because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry, in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest, and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.

They would admit, of course, that the term ""Trinity"" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as ""The Angel of the Lord"" and the ""Word of Yahweh"" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, ""some"" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nSome other inaccuracies... or perhaps misconseptions is a better word... first, you assume that taking part in a war for independance is a violation of ones obligation... that is often a matter of interpretation.  To a Mason like George Washington, he was not being disloyal to England... rather he was upholding his obligation by being loyal to ""the country in which he lived""... ie Virginia (and, later, America).  Second, You seem to assume that Masons were united in their opinions.  They were not.  In each of the conflicts you mention there were Masons on both sides... all of whom felt that they were living up to their obligations.  (Freemasonry was just as divided as the rest of society). Yes, today we celebrate those ""famous Masonic Leaders"", Washington, Franklin and Handcock... that's because they won.  If the Americans had lost the war for independance you would probably read all about those ""famous Masonic Leaders"": Bannister Tarlton, Phillip Skeen, and General Cornwallis.

I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it ""2005 Census"".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I've had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nEach in turn\n\nSuggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.\nThe addition of ""and"" is good. However, a force need not be ""perceived"" to exist. The definition of ""acceleration"" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.\nProvide definition: ""momentum (quantity of motion)""\nHmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.\nFollowing the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a ""force"" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the ""force"" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.\nThere is a slight issue here with the sentence: ""Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a ""force"" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a ""force"" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.\n\nI will implement the wording I think is good, but let's keep discussing the problematic wording.\n\n  "

__label__non_toxic "\n\n Request opinion of Muslim editor \n\nHello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say ""Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying ""Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — "
__label__non_toxic "\n\nAlthough I respect your admiration for it isn't the statements about ""sterling writing style"" a bit subjective? Can you in least cite book reviewers that indicate it's really that good? I'm not going to complain or anything I'm just saying."
__label__non_toxic Gnip is on the right track here, though I would like to suggest a few corrections to his last statement. The reason the book received so much negative feedback from academics was not only because of its high profile, but it certainly did play a major role. Historians did definitely want to counter the widespread praise the book was receiving from journalists and other non-specialists, but it was also the book’s clear and obvious failings that drew a lot of attention from academics, who felt it was their responsibility to expose the book’s problematic research and unsubstantiated conclusions. Any work claiming to provide a comprehensive biography of one of the world's most famous (or infamous) leaders will get noticed, and will certainly be watched closely by academics specializing in China studies. As someone currently working within this very millieu, I can say that most specialists I know of have spoken to were at least aware of the book. Gnip is, however, correct that the published response to the book (such as the Benton volume, or the China Journal response) were unusual, as I have stated before in this article's discussion. I think this is the part that is getting lost on John Smith's, unfortunately. Though I may be splitting hairs rehashing Gnip's words, what I am trying to clarify is that people should not be under the impression that academics only noticed the book due it its huge publicity. It is not correct to say that without its ‘high profile’ “the academic world would [never have known] about such a book.” Professional historians deal daily with the “low profile”, often reviewing books that never become very popular or well-known (ie. they don't sell very well outside of academia). In fact, they frequently research and dissect works that few outside of a very small circle of individuals will ever read. In this sense, academics are very insulated in what they do, and are often disconnected from the general public. That is not to say, however, that they are unaware of new publications outside of academia, particularly those re-evaluating major figures in history. Also, Benton’s volume “Was Mao Really a Monster” was not, in my opinion, a major contributor to the book’s popularity, as Gnip suggests. As you know, MTUS was first published in 2005, and this collection of reviews was only published in 2009, quite some time after the book had already become popular (and as you know, the reviews found in the volume had been previously published elsewhere). What is important about this recent volume is not how it contributed to the book’s popularity, in my opinion, but rather as a reflection of how distressed the academic community truly is by the MTUS’s continued popularity. This last fact is what I am concerned does not quite get across in the article, as it stands. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to appropriately correct that issue. I think that is what Midnightblueowl has been trying to address, and what I myself tried to do some time ago.

Further, I notice alot of articles about Vancouver's neighbouring municipalities that do not mention the official names of such municipalities.  Why simply say ""Delta"" when one should be saying ""The Incorporation of Delta"" when the government website of that municipality uses such as a legalistic title? I know that lawyers are the only type of people who really care about municipal boundaries and official names, but this is still Wikipedia and all the technical and legalistic details should be mentioned.  After all, municipalities, whether a city, town, township, village, etc., are merely creations of the law of incorporation.\n\nI was wondering if any person living in the Greater Vancouver Area had a hand in writing this article because there is lack of distinction being made between the City of Vancouver (i.e. Vancouver proper) and the surrounding municipalities such as the City of Burnaby, City of Richmond, etc.  Until the Greater Vancouver Area undergoes the type of municipal amalgamations as seen in the Toronto, Ottawa and Hamilton areas, this important distinction must be made.  This article should not use the simple word ""Vancouver"" to mean the larger metro area that includes Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Doing so would be very confusing to a reader in view of the Greater Vancouver Area map with all those municipal boundaries drawn in.\n\nUser:Alf74 "

TS \n\n@Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are\n\n Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.  \n Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly)\n Theoretical model: Feedback\n\nAs to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. \n\nThe explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article. \n\nThe role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.\n\nThe section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.

I drop the hint about the V-PRC survey and your sorry lot still go on about Kiesling's State Department estimate. \n Even after citing the Eurominority reports (while making sure the Arvanitika in Epirus are shown as Albanian) you still have not updated your map of linguistic minorities in Greece to show the Arvanites in Thrace. I mean you fools show half of my island as Arvanite speaking when the language is unfortunately almost entirely lost and despite there being more active speakers in Thrace you don't even show them. So much for ""expertise"" and respect for the sources.\n You complain that you are misunderstood with respect to your broad use of the color brush in the map of Macedonian Slavic dialects in Greece even when it is pointed out to you that your color maps include areas where there were never any settlements of Slavic speaking villages at all. Then you trivialize objections (""a few kilometers"" etc.) and suggest that what you do is perfectly kosher. But when you prepare a similar map of Greek dialects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_Greek_dialects_en.svg instead of following the same rationale and including areas of minimal use of the Greek language (even if it was in the past and no more - just as you argue for your Macedonian map) you stop at the borders of Greece. Obviously the Greeks in Albania and Bulgaria (I won't bother with the Greek linguistic presence - especially in the past - in the Bitola, Gevgelija and Strumica region as I expect them to be invisible to you) are not worth recording (or maybe they are mute in your pretty little world). What about the Greek speaking Turks still left in Turkey (mainly from Crete and Macedonia as well as the Pontus)? I mean OK, screw the linguistic presence in Turkey before 1922 - you obviously have perverse ideas of what time boundaries to use - but at least respect today's reality. If my grandfather's bilingual generation of Arvanite speakers make half the island of Andros Arvanite should you not indicate the presence of the Greek speaking old-people in Turkey? Your double standards are so blatantly obvious it is not even funny that a person such as you wields so much power in WP.

It is now forced into single-word lines, extending down past the reference section. ,It looks ridiculous. You quoted IMGSIZE, yet again, in the summary. That policy states:\n In general, do not use px without very good reason\n\nWhat that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:\nWhere px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.\n\nI have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.\n\nSurely you can see this. Since you're quoting this policy so much, surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit. I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article, both before and after the edit, and in doing so,. surely you see the need for this edit.

__label__non_toxic ":::::: Again, most of that is gibberish to me, but the first place to begin sorting it might be ... I do not know why BogHog changed to vcite or to vcite2 after he took over maintaining the Diberri tool.  Nor do I know what that means in every case.  The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory.  That may or may not mean BogHog explained it all to me once  ... and I may or may not have understood at the time.  When I use Boghog's new Diberri tool, I edit the output to use the old standard form, for consistency in citation style.  And I continue to use the vcite format in the autism suite.  That we now have a mix on FAs is because new editors may not always respect CITEVAR, and I may not catch them all.

__label__non_toxic Density confusion? \n\nI just changed the density figures to be 5600 +/- 1300 as the previous numbers were 5.6 +/- 1.3 which would correspond to gm per cubic cm, but the info box gives the figure as kg per cubic metre.  If the planet has a surface gravity of nearly 3G then there's no way its real density is only 5.6 kilograms per cubic metre.

Kosova was conquered, right? It was 75% Albanian, right? It was never legally drafted into Serbia, we know because if there was a real ""treaty in London"" then Noel Maclom would have added it to his ""Is Kosova Serbia?"" article. I prefer to use the term ""annexed"" because it was a completely illegal incorporation into the territory. And as Malcolm said (if you read the source), after 1918, it went back to being a self-governing (by it's Albanians) land within a ""Yugoslavia"" NOT part of Serbia. I believe Serbia's first ever involvement with Kosova after 1912 was when in 1989 Milosevic made his famous ""Greater Serbia"" speech in Kosova, started to move Serbs into the county and then send his Serb troops to invade the land and expand Serbia's territory, followed by the ethnic cleansing of Albanians/non-Serbs, and genocide of the rest. It was also then that ""Metohia"" was added to the name and I know this because as I said before, I have Kosovan friends. BBC/Sky all adhere too. Or are they not reliably neutral?   "

That being said I know the actual and legal name of the congregation and that is why I corrected it. However you need only check the name against records of the New York Secretary of State. I was not engaging in a debate over the name of the congregation founded by my grandfather, however I will address factual inaccuracies when I see them. \nThe temple owned by the congregation was fraudulently transferred and that is currently being litigated with trial set for  April 14,2014. See NY Post 2007; Wall Street Journal 2010. Jewish Week 2007. One of the issues was the fraudulent use of the name of the congregation to transfer title, the name in the Wikipedia article.\nDavid M.

If just 10% came forward, that would mean at least 20 complaints, and that figure would not have been secret a for long once the press got hold of the story. I do not profess to understand the workings of the abuser or those that have been abused but it does beg the question - did Savile have such power over his victims that they were so terrified to come forward or are some of the now presented cases just a case of get what you can while you can in this time of recession?

__label__non_toxic "NatureBoyMD, Macman202, Tony Fox:\n\nI have considered your disrespectful comments towards my Scholarly Review article and, now that the Christmas holidays are over, I am obliged to let my anger with your remarks be known. I shall start with you, NatureBoyMD. NatureBoyMD, you reffered to my article as dubious. This is ironic, considering that you as a person are quite dubious. When I read your opinions of my article, I scoff at you. Your argument is so ill founded that I cannot even take you seriously. It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's ""dubiousness"", but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general. If you think people need a citation as to where the camera in Say Cheese and Die came from,, then you need to understand what is common knowledge and not. For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots ""are masterfully formulated"" or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. \nAs for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature ""has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard"" (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself). MacMan, it is quite bold of you to assume that there is so scholar behind my article. Perhaps you should stick to editing the Simon and Garfunkel page on wikipedia. I am sure you are quite familiar with it already.\nTony Fox, you and NatureBoyMD seem to be on the  same page as far as your inability to recognize common knowledge is concerned. To me it seems that you label anything you do not agree with as a ""peacock term."" I find this most repulsive, as I, like most free thinking, intelligent people believe that speech should not be censored because someone does not agree with it. You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps. When you feel that you have researched Goosebumps as much as I have (it is very unlikely that you ever will) then you may suggest alterations to my scholarly review. Until then, your comments are not welcome, and they certainly will not be tolerated any longer. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Swain Goosebumps Appreciation Society\n\n"

You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo!

__label__non_toxic US States name game is a terrible example \n\nDue to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:\nOver 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.\nAlmost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.\nThe only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.\nThere are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)\nMaybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

So, please accompany your explanations with some decisive decisions.  Whether they work or not, I think you'll be supported just because you're trying to do something.   "

There is simply no actual person named ""Chelsea Manning"" here. What we have is a man named ""Bradley Manning"" who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly ""Breanna"") and referred to as ""she"". That is all. That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called ""Chelsea"". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say ""Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act..."" and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.

__label__non_toxic Notability\nI certainly wouldn't call the band extremely popular, but I don't think they're obscure to the point where they are completely unnotable. (Although I'm not exactly sure what a band needs to be notable, honestly, so I could be wrong.) They've recieved attention by the mainstream press, and they have a large and growing fanbase. A Google search for their name shows half a million results, most of which are about the band, even towards the last pages. I'm sure I've seen much more obscure bands on Wikipedia. I myself am neither in the band, nor a huge fan of the band, so I didn't write this with the intent to advertise. I wrote the stub because it was on the requested articles list, and I recognized the name. So you could blame scant details more on my lack of knowledge than on the band's obscurity. Personally, I don't think it should be deleted, however it could use some work by someone who knows more information about the band. =)

A single paragraph description of the content is not the same as a lengthy review. I think the current book descriptions are ok. If some Jws are not happy, why don't they put some 'positive' books in the positive section as a balance? Reducing book descriptions until they are meaningless, or so vague that no one knows what they are about, is a rather surreptitious form of direct censorship, or reader manipulation at the least, and should not be encoraged. We all need to be honest about our motives for ""this or that"" change to any Wikepedia article. I also noted a lot of accusations about POV this and that, but if we feel something is POV, surely we have to put forth a good and specific argument against the information, before it is changed to something else. Simply saying, ""X is POV, therefore I will zap it"" cannot be good enough.

__label__non_toxic Don´t hide correct information, instead help people get access to it \n\nHi Tournesol, Wikipedia have never been about consensus. Wikipedia is about making new correct and useful information public for a brooder amount of people quicker and within a shorter time interval than ordinary dictionaries.\nThis means researchers with a specific knowledge may help other people get access to it and speedup the expansion of the world mainstream knowledge. I think you agree It´s a god deed to share information even if this knowledge is regarded new for the ordinary layman and in the forefront of science.\nWikipedia has never been about satisfying some perverse peoples needs to act as deputies for bureaucratic hegemonies. \nFor example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.\nAnd do you Tournesol really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?
__label__non_toxic There is nothing racialist about that. Its true that the article sounds very mediterranean and still it does. Also its true that the modern Bulgarians are nothing turkic, as they are white europeans. Aren't Bulgarians white? Then what race are they? Croats are our closest relatives and they are proven by scientists. Also in many Bulgarian historical books it states clearly that the Bulgarians are closely related to the Hungarians and Croats as they were all part of one tribe in Eastern Europe. To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous. Bulgarians are a mixture of slavic, alpine, dinaric, mediterranean, nordic and pontid. Pontids and the north pontids are about 50% of the population and they are a mix of atlanto mediterranean heritage and nordic people.

__label__non_toxic "early 2004, before or after brendon's joining, and interviews that say the band was formed in 2005 may be in refernce to when they were signed and became a real band, rather than a basic garage band. Either way, Ryan wasn't necessarily lying and a more fitting title may be a good idea.\n\n Emo \n\nThis band has emo lyrics, that should be stated somewhere in the article, I would add it myself but I'm probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan. \n\nPunk-Pop\nPunk Revival\nEmo\n\nAre SUGGESTED STYLES from allguide.com\n\nThe term ""emo"" is thrown around so loosly and it's become a label that bands and other people see to be offended by, I don't think that it's necessary to state that in the article, especially since ""emo"" has no real definition in the first place.\n\n Former Band Members Section? \n\nDo any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for ""Former Members"" and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not? I don't like the fact that it's just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal. \n\n Wikiproject proposal \n\nI've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one. The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic! at the Disco pages (including members of the band, songs and albums). If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  \n\nmany people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed ""none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""-ryan ross\n\n""emo""\n\nWouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? ""Emo"" is basically this generation's ""grunge"". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because ""emo"" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. ""Grunge"" bands hated being called grunge too. \n\nAnd there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.\n\nAgreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. \n\nA lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |  \n\n Early 2007 album \n\nIt says their new album will be ready for compalation in early 2007, that's not true in Rolling Stone Ryan says He plans to write/ record the album during the summer of 2007 and release it during the fall of 2007. I would add it but i've never done anything like that before so I figured i'd just put it in here. http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/panic_at_the_disco_high_school_musical?source=panicatthedisco_rssfeed That's the link to the rolling stone thing by the way.\n\n Panic and FOB..... together? \n\n       I've been liking Fall Out Boy and Panic since last June.

__label__non_toxic "\nEnric, you present an impoverished idea of what Wikipedia editors can and should do. We do not report demonstrably false information as fact just because a reliable source says it, unless we balance it. We can and should balance secondary source error with primary source fact. The requirement is that the primary source facts reported should be directly verifiable without synthesis, by any ordinary person with ordinary skill applying reasonable effort. First of all, it's worth reading WP:OR over carefully. Then look at the essay linked from the WP:OR page, WP:NOTOR. See, specifically, this example:\nA book, short story, film, or other work of fiction is a primary source for any article or topic regarding that work. Anything that can be observed by a reasonable person simply by reading the work itself, without interpretation, is not original research, but is reliance upon a primary source. This would include direct quotes or non interpretative summaries, publication dates, and any other patent information that can be observed from the work. For example, if there are multiple versions of a particular story, and one version does not have a particular character, or has extra characters, that is clear simply by reading or watching the work. The fact that one would have to read or watch the whole thing does not make the matter original research. The work is verifiable, even if it takes more time than flipping to a single page.\nNotice that the example is quite on point here: After reporting what the DoE report says is claimed in the review document about the sixteen samples, 'blah blah.' we could say, ""The Hagelstein paper, which was the review document, does not contain a report of 'blah blah.' However, it does contain 'bleep bleep.'"" And there is probably more than we can say; there is some criticism of the 2004 report in reliable source, if I'm correct. This tidbit, however, requires no source other than the 2004 DoE material.\nNotice also that we probably cannot report, for example, that ""The 2004 DoE report contradicted itself,"" unless we have secondary source on that. What we properly do is to present the elements of the (alleged) contradiction, without claiming contradiction, reliably sourced, and let the reader form his or her own conclusion. The elements are directly verifiable. The conclusion isn't.   "

__label__non_toxic No problem, didn't want to move this conversation as I figured it would be wierd ) Well, first of all, if we look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Scream.jpg, and The Madonna etc, we see that several of these old pictures are in so-called public domain in The USA. And this being the American version of Wikipedia I would think that this link could be added as well. I noticed that the link-page which is on the Norwegian version of this Edvard Munch website, isn't in the English version, and this page cites books and websites as the sources of both images and text. Now, I can see that one may hesitate to link to a website like this, but if one were to deny every similar website (in other subjects/articles) to be linked to when the content is of such importance as it is here, Wikipedia wouldn't be much to look at -) You can find - probably thousands - of links of the same kind in all kinds of subjects and articles on Wikipedia. But as I said, I don't want to start an argument about this, I just think it's interesting to look into a case like this. What can and what can't be linked to... It's no big deal for me personally, but Wikipedia should set a standard and stick to it 100 percent. I just feel that the public should be able to see some other artworks of Edvard Munch than just The Scream and The Madonna... Especially when the artist has been dead for over 60 years (in regarding of copyright in several countries). Oh, well... Time for a cup of coffee -) ( )

__label__non_toxic Nephilim deleted edit \n\nYou state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).\nThis aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. \nThe next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. \nHere is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.\nThe next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.\nThis again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?\nYou may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.\nOnce before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.\nThe reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader.

As far as I am concerned, either we need to include the 2014 report or not mention either of them, as it gives a false impression that nothing has occurred in the intervening time. we could also drop the 2013 report in favour of the 2014 one, as it is more rigorous and in any case answers the same and many more questions.

If you really share the idea that ""the Russian has no regard for human life and they are all out sons-of-bitches, barbarians, and chronic drunks"", and you really want that idea to be implemented in the article, you probably should not edit Wikipedia. That is my last warning.  \nPS. Taking into account that the full Patton's quote (""The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinese or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other amiable characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and they are all out sons-of-bitches, barbarians, and chronic drunks."") has such a profound idea that ""good Russian is a dead Russian"", I see absolutely no use in this quote for the Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany talk page. You either remove this post completely or I report you.  \nPPS I also expect you to immediately remove all racist crap from your user page . You have one day for that.  \nThank you Anonymiss Madchen.

__label__non_toxic Go ahead and change it, it's a wiki and everybody can improve it.
__label__non_toxic Huh? \n\nI didn't change the nature of the article and wrote the sidenote because it is apparent that though many people edit thsi article, very few of those editors have spent much time with Biff, drunk, or sober. I have. I know what he's like, and he's not nice, to women especially. I think it's important that no matter what happens here, it happens with some kind of consensus. What I'm seeing is gross abuse on each side of the story. You and Willmcw are no better than Jonah and his many aliases- which for the record i find offensive. Furthermore, your quote on my talk page is erroneous. You don't know exactly who I am. I came to this place to write about things near and dear to me. The Biff Rose edits have generateda little bit of notoreity with those that know him, as i'm sure you are aware. Biff is largely responsible for that. he likes to spread his fame. \n\nI've noticed on the pages and pages and pages of talk about Biff that you've been every bit as antagonistic and as the Jonah Ayer/ Steve espinola ones. You seem to try and trap them into bad behavior. But you do it in such a manner that is inappropriate here on wikipedia. mind oyu, I've not been on here for as long as you have, guessing from the timetable of your postings. I can say this, by being so incredibly hardheaded about Biff, you end up becoming less of a standard bearer for the moral right side of the street, and seem akin to whom you accuse. Willmcw believes your point of view, and you his, and that's unfortunately created a definition of biff that even hhe himself must be getting a hoot from. \n\nYou don't know me. Maybe you've been to the same bar where I once worked, maybe you even ordered a drink from me, maybe I chatted you up. But that certainly doesn't give you the right to claim knowledge of me. I think that's offensive, as offensive as Jonah Ayers or whoever he is claiming that Biff was a child molester. I'm a nice person and I think that's what happens with Biff. He finds nice people to glom up to, and eventually the true nature of his personality comes to the front, and it's not such a clearly angelic personality as I'm sure you've seen if you ever had to spend any amount of time with him at all, when he was drinking. he was a paying customer at two bars I worked at, and so I had to stomach some rather base and quite frankly aberrantly sexist remarks from him, on a regular basis. It was people like him that helpeed me decide that it was time to leave the city of New Orleans. Another one was Barry Cowsill, who sadly has gone missing since Katrina hit. Barry however had an excuse; he was diagnosed as Bi polar, and when he was off his meds and drinking, there was nothing he could do to mend his behavior. Biff had no medical diagnosis to alter my opinion of him. The cases are similar because both men experienced some minor amount of notoreity due to their musical prowess, and were not able to channel that into permanent success like many of their contemporaries, lesser talents who had much better managers or agents. Southern Louisiana is peppered with what are known as almost weres and has beens. Sugarboy Crawford, whose song Iko Iko you might know, stopped performing after a steel plate was implanted in his head after a brutal beating at the hands of white police officers. James Booker, one of the most noted pianists to play in the New Orleans style died on a hospital gurney after getting himself to Charity Hospital in the middle of over  dosing on heroin, only to be left ot his own devices for six hours, in which time he died. The thing is, those men were not only major influences on the culture of their time and place, but on further generations after they were no longer playing. Both  Barry and Biff may well have influenced others, but never to the degree of the other two men I mentioned. That doesn't make them lesser artists, just less influential. Not one of the four of them had very big sales at any point of their careers. However when I got the chance to meet Sugarboy Crawford, he was kind and courteous. And he stayed that way, no matter how many times he nipped from the bottle wrapped in brown paper in his hip pocket. \n\nI lived in the New Orleans because I got an academic scholarship to Tulane. I worked in the french quarter bars because I discovered that was where the real money was to be made in New Orleans. Did you know that? I don't think so. I went out amongst the musicians because I loved the openness that most of them showed, and that Biff seemed to have at first. I found that most of them had experienced some degree of shell shock from having worked in the confines of the recording industry, and yet still seemed to be wonderstruck. Again, Biff fit right in; again, at first. But I found that many more of them continued to develop their skills, and work in the industry or on the fringe of it, because music was in their blood. Biff was dissimilar in th

__label__non_toxic Well there's been a lot said, if I can just address Kolzene's point first. I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.

Nobody is arguing that a candidate with a majority of first preferences is passed-over in favor of a weaker candidate, nor that some valid ballots are simply ignored...yet that is the impression that Abd's choice of words leaves with most readers. His summary of the issue does not capture the thrust of the main claim that exhausted ballots can lead to sub-50% winners, nor even the much rarer claim that candidates with much less core support, but broader secondary support, may get eliminated.\n \n\n"

__label__non_toxic "==Additions to Origins: The Subjects==\nI feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  ""Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.\n\nIn order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:\n\nIndigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia.

They dedicate a staff to searching an entire field for the most reliable and recognized experts in a field and then they each write chapters in a text. It is extremely, extremely difficult to write an article in a Blackwell Companion. If nobody 'took her seriously' she wouldn't have been selected to write it.\n\nIn addition, all of the articles I linked were in peer reviewed journals. It would be different if they were random things she just put out on the internet or something, but these are serious texts.\n\nIn addition, I am NOT a student of Professor Sher. I was asked to write the article by two of her students. I would not write an article on someone I knew personally. I AM a researcher in philosophical logic. I myself am an expert in the field, and well equipped to access significance. \n\nEtchemendy's arguments were major. Her arguments were the significant reply. Why don't you question the length and breadth of the John Etchemendy article, which cites no links to any work, no academic sources, and only a biography webpage from his office?

__label__non_toxic . The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.\n\nTABFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.\n\nTABBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.\n\nTABAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:\n\n“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),\n\nMoses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision. The Book of the Deuteronomy confirms that God did not impose circumcision to Moses

__label__non_toxic "\n\n biography of Lazar Kaganovich \n\na Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?\n\nLazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. \n\nThe book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.\n\nTo sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.\n\nIn 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of ""wet affairs,"" with ""wet"" meaning ""bloody."" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.\n\nWhen the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. ""Your hands are blood-stained too,"" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.\n\nAs I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. \n\nKaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.\n\nYours,\n\n"

If one opens Demographics of Bulgaria in NationMaster, one will see the wikipedia article 70 days exactly at the pointn when it was subject to vandalism by an anonomous user who frivolously (ha! it is not only Antidote who does such things but may be Antidote and anonymous are the same person???) tampered with the data from Census 2001. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much, Antidote for providing us with this extremely precious information. (Applause waited)\n\nUser:Antidote takes an estimate of the Factbook and calculates on his own ethnic distributions using the 2001 census up to the hundreds!!! How wise that is, my dear, I am thrilled!!! Has the thought that YOU MAY NOT DO OWN CALCULATIONS crossed your mind? Have you thought that ethnic distributions in 2001 may not be valid in 2005? What if the number of Bulgarians suddenly exploded? Or that it suddenly plunged? Ha???\n\nSo, the estimate of the Factbook... Some organisation based in Washington makes an estimation without giving any ground for its estimations, without being a statistics organization but User:Antidote thinks this is the best source he could take a 2005 estimate from. Well, the Factbook may be well-publiced but Brittney Spears is well-publicised, as well, and her music is shite. Look at these two links, the first one is the official estimate of Eurostat for 2005  (7,761,000), the other one is an encyclopedia quoting the official estimate of the UN for 2003  (7,897,000). These are REPUTABLE STATISTICS ORGANISATIONS and compared with them, the Factbook is worthless. Other questions, my dear?\n\nOver the last couple of months, you have shown remarkable obstinacy to include moronic estimates and judgements of your own, not only here but also in other articles. I have been pointing out what I summarised above for several months in a row, are you so thick that you can't figure it out or what?

__label__non_toxic Go back and re-read my numerous comments about that.  No, Dodo merely used 'boilerplate' documents, pre-written, as if that was sufficient.  It wasn't.  I have raised MANY objections since his initial deletorreah, and no, he has not addressed 98%+ of what I said.  Hint:  Templates, or 'boilerplate' text, is only appropriate if the person who uses it has applied it correctly, and modified it to address case-specific issues.  Templates may be the BEGINNING of a good response, but they are rarely the END.  'Dodo' (and most others 'addressing' the issue, to the extent that they 'address' it) pretends that he can point his finger at my posts, but at the same time ignore HIS OWN actions!  THat's not surprising:  His actions were thoroughly premature, improper, rude, and abusive.  Unless you are willing to actually address my specific objections to his actions, your defense of Dodo is no better than 'meat puppetry'.  Others have behaved exactly like you, so you're in bad company.

__label__non_toxic Where does Eagle Forum support Dominionism? For this to be useful, it should have some quote from Eagle Forum or from a reliable source that documents Eagle Forum support for Dominionism. But none of the references actually says that Eagle Forum has any Dominionist views. None of them is an objective source. And none of them actually criticizes some Eagle Forum view.\n TheocracyWatch quotes Glenn Scherer saying that Eagle Forum has rated some US Senators differently from environmentalist groups. Mother Jones said that Eagle Forum has supported a Republican group, and some of those Republicans had once supported Pat Robertson. That is very far removed from Eagle Forum supporting Dominionism. If Eagle Forum says that environmentalism is contrary to the Bible, or if Eagle Forum supported Pat Robertson for president, then those things might be notable and criticism of those views might be notable. But I cannot find anything like that in any of the references. Unless someone finds some better references, the paragraph should be removed.

I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. ""Port Adelaide 138"" rather than the preferred format ""Port Adelaide 138"". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow.

If you can prevent them from committing suicide, it will save the doctors alot of paper work and help advance their careers. Genius, creativity and excentricity has absolutely no business associating with autism.\n\nAutism is simply a disorder that makes it harder for a person with the condition to interact with other people.

__label__non_toxic "\n You People... \n...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.\n\nOnce the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.\n\nIf you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.\n\nAll of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask ""if they can be white, then why should I not be?""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  \n\nSadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.\n\nI still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.\n\nAlso, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning ""your type of whites as opposed to my type"" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.  It is

It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. \n\nAlso, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.\n\nI think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!\n\nSo your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.\n\nThe next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to ""soil"" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!\n\ntsk tsk..\n\n  \n\n Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi \n\nDo not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.\n\nNow whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?  \n\nCan we also be enlightened under what rules of Wikipedia not understood by vandals, is this kind of editing and then awarding an article such as this riddled with holes is permissible?\n\n[

From the surrounding wording, it is clear that the Founders were referring to a single legal entity and believed they were constituting such an entity.  So ""the United States of America"" is the legal name of the federal government.  There are also many sections in the United States Code which refer to ""the United States of America.""\n\n 20:49, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n\n They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as ""the United States"" because before 1787, they were semi-independent.  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a ""Union"" hence how they became the ""United.""  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the ""Articles of Confederation"" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — 21:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n\nI hold a bachelor's degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States.

I don't think so since so many people watch this page anyway...  (talk) 20:31, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\n Republicans and religious Jews \n\nExcuse me.  In the ""Politics"" section, the following sentence appears:\n\nThe Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups, religious Christians and Jews, and rural Americans, while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups.\n\nIn the history,  sliced out the phrase ""and Jews"" and then  promptly reverted it.  Now, I'm a little confused.  Historically, when Jews are considered as a voting bloc, they tend to lean Democratic.  However, this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from non-religious Jews.  Therefore, my question:\n\nDoes anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican (or Democratic)?\n\n—  21:28, 2004 Dec 30 (UTC)\n\n Social Issues \n\nI added some more information about the incarceration/prison situation in the US.

Yet you only seem to be only concerned with me. They can pretty much carry on in no unclear terms.

__label__non_toxic Alas, for those who have a degree in CpE, we by default consider ourselves very different than CS or EE because many still do not know we exist.  If you look at most engineering categories you will see CS and EE listed and CE not listed in many cases because many still do not recognize or realize what a CpE does that is different than CS or EE. Cmp is more specialized in areas of mainly digital systems hardware and software whilst EE is more in to. . . everything electrical (from the atomic level to power grids). Think of a discipline who straddles the fence between the fields of EE and CS (then slips off both ;-)). That's where CpE would unfortunately  land.

__label__non_toxic "\n Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment \n\nAlright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being ""unreferenced crap"" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as ""vandalism,"" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.\n\nLet's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. \n\nThen, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them ""unreferenced crap"" or ""vandal"" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.\n\nAnd again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his ""massive increase"" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called ""crap"" information like ""Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like ""scientist Gero"" added to the unclear information that simply said ""Red Ribbon"" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. \n\nAnd finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority. \n\nThanks for your time."

__label__non_toxic , 7 June 2009 (UTC)\n\nYou could take your images with a black background and remove it using Photoshop or GIMP. You're probably right about OsO4, although it is possible to show  a bit of packing. Not necessary though, molecular structures are mostly about the molecule! I respectfully disagree that space-filling models are less desirable than ball-and-stick models. Graphite intercalation compound is a prime example! You can see the way the potassium atoms prop open the graphite layers. Both styles are complementary - although in some cases, one may be much clearer.\n\nThanks for adding the reference to File:Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png. I've updated the image description. I think it's important to give the source that was actually used for the image, rather than any convenient reference that seems to say the same thing. Sometimes there are differences or mistakes in sources that we don't notice until later.\n\nYou make a good point about noting atom colours explicitly. I will start to do that in my image descriptions. It's not always practical, though, to add a caption. Chemboxes are a notable example. And often, it is easy to deduce which atom is which colour, e.g. phosphorus pentafluoride!\n\n  12:20

__label__non_toxic Of course a sphere works, think about it logically: If you travel along the surface of a sphere in any direction, you'll end up back where you started. The problem is simply a matter of perspective, by comparing it to traditional maps of Earth you're getting nowhere. To make all directions loop properly, all you have to do is stretch the sphere flat while cutting only a single point in it, let's use the north pole. Now, stretch it out into a square. The entire perimiter of the map is the north pole, while the south pole is in the center. On a sphere, moving over a single point in a strait line causes you to come out on the other side of that point. On this version of the map, since the perimeter is a single point, you always come out on the other side.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nEichenwald\n\nOne thing that caught my attention when I read the NYT article was the claim that Justin gave his ""customer records"" to the Times, and they checked the 1500 ""pedophiles"" and found they were from all walks of life.  Now, at the time Justin shut down his porn operation, he was a legal adult, and was running a web site indistinguishable from any other pay adult site, replete with the required notice that ""All Models are over 18 years of age, records on file.""  Does that mean that anyone who paid for access to that Web site with a credit card got lumped in with the people who paid Justin for webcam performances when he was 14?  This is the kind of shoddy agenda-laden reporting typical in these cases.  Does anyone remember when the US government busted an age verification service because two web sites that used their codes, located in foreign countries, had underage material on them?  They then characterized everyone who'd bought an age verification code as ""people who had paid for access to child porn,"" and shopped the customer list around to a bunch of other countries for sting operations.\n\nAny reporting on alleged child porn in the US suffers from a number of problems, most notable of which is the fact that even journalists are legally prohibited from looking at the material in question to report to readers whether its content is being lied about.  It's basically a situation in which you can write anything, no matter how outrageous, about ""international pedophile rings"" and ""luring"" and ""poor little abused children"" and it will get published with no fact-checking, and in an environment in which no one can be publicly suspicious about its claims, for fear of attracting negative attention to themselves.\n\nI haven't seen a single article in the mainstream press in the last ten years on the subject of child porn that wasn't deliberately inflammatory, dripping with value-laden terminology, and full of deliberate lying by omission, juxtiposition, and innuendo.  Mr. Eichenwald's relationship with Justin Berry clearly violated almost every rule of objective journalism.  Given that the NY Times article is a single source for the entire Justin Berry story, basing an encyclopedia article solely on that article, and on derivative journalism generated by it, is an example of ""truthiness,"" not ""factiness.""

Bush in the same article it would only make sense to be more specific).   05:42, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)\n\nthe madness never ends.\n\n Quotes \n\nQuotes mentioned should be in {{wikiquotes}} not here.  == 14:20, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)\n\n""I am not a crook"" & ""never obstructed justice""\nText of press conference , extracted version . \n\nNeither of the above partial and incomplete transcripts contain Nixon's quote, or the question to which he responded.\nyou can't find it in the official text of http://watergate.info/judiciary/APPI.PDF, or the extrated version, cause it's not there. The House Judiciary Committee which was holding the Watergate hearings, it appears, did feel question's on Nixon's personal finances and taxes returns were not germane to thier proceedings.\nSounds like a conspiracy theory to me.  I'm sure there is a transcript out there that contains both the question asked of Nixon, as well as his response, that the 'plumbers' haven't gotten to yet.   7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)\n\nFrom Facts on File 1973, Volume 33, No. 1719 Oct. 7-13, 1973, pg. 854, \n""The White House refused to confirm or deny an Oct. 3 report in the Providence (R.I.)

I make my fair share of mistakes as well.

The best they can do is call it Watergate related, or allied.\n Actually, you are incorrect.  The Post article specifically states that he was responding to Watergate related questions.  Of course he is talking about his personal finances and taxes when he says he has never profited from his position  but that is not the whole quote.  You seem to keep evading discussion on the part where he also denies obstructing justice.  I believe that if we had a transcript of exactly what he is responding to, it would go a long way to clearing things up.  7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)\n\nIt does, however, support the fact that the cursory investigations were indeed related to the Watergate investigations: ""After months of torment over the Watergate and allied scandals, the President gave detailed answers to more than a dozen questions.""''

__label__non_toxic slow the VFDTOAFD bot down? \n\nHello,\n\nWould it be possible to slow the VFDTOAFD bot down?  It's not overwhelming the bandwidth or resources of Wikipedia, but it is overwhelming the ability of human eyes to monitor the pagemove log (more than 5000 edits today alone).  Once any currently-being-voted-on VfD's are converted to AfD (I think that happened already quite some time ago), the old archived ones can be converted at much more leisurely pace, no?  Perhaps a few hundred a day?  Hardly anyone ever really looks at old archived VfD's, so there's no screaming urgency.  My worry is specifically that vandals may sneak in some pagemove vandalism in there that no one will catch, in the midst of thousands and thousands of other pagemoves, or a vanity userspace page will get moved to article space and no one will catch it (last time I checked, such a pagemove didn't show up in the Newpages log).   How much more of a backlog is there for the bot to do before completion?
__label__non_toxic I can tell you that Intangible is right on this point.  Gerolf and the fellow posters do not know what neocons are.  However, it is always nice for a party accused of racism to try to connect with a more moderate group like the neocons, and it is also nice for a left-wing newspaper to connect a racist group with a main movement in the United States.  So, I will look up the interview with Paul Beliën in which he cleary denies any link or connection with the USA and the Vlaams Belang.  (and Beliën is a credible source here)

__label__non_toxic Let's leave Alan's motives out of it.  The fact is, Alan's own transcripts on his own website prove that the statements on pp.47-8 of his book about the jurors William Waters and Randolph Holinshed re the Brincknell incident are factually wrong.  Are we trying to improve the article by making it factually correct, or are we merely trying to score debating points?  My objective is to improve the article by making it factually correct.  However if I edit it, my edit will be reverted, so it's obviously up to you to decide whether or not to remove the erroneous statements about the jurors William Waters and Randolph Holinshed, as well as the citation to Alan's book in that regard, isn't it?

At this time it was noticed that a small hill (referred to in the source as 'public school hill') just south of the stream dominated the nearby areas and had to be taken as well.1500 New objective taken.\nFrom same source, order by the commander of the 18th Division - http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=4961148 (p. 206-207) defines the front line on 4 September 1941 after that attack by the III/JR6 as follows:\n3. Our regiment (excluding I/JR6) mans the 'Aleksandrovka section' (of the front line)... ...Edge on the right: Begins from Rajajoki (River Sestra) at roughly 1 km north of the railroad bridge and following the stream east from there...\nSo according to both to the war diary of the Finnish battalion (3rd Battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment) responsible for the direction just north of N. Beloostrov and according to the war diary of its' parent unit, or the 6th Infantry Regiment, the Finnish front lines did not run further to the south from the stream in question (Serebryanyi) than extending to cover the 'public school hill'. And run 1/2 to 1 km north of the N. Beloostrov on the 4 September 1941 following the Finnish attacks. -

__label__non_toxic "\n\nRomantic Friendship, Not Lesbianism\n\nThis article needs to be edited to change the way it deals with the argument that the Ladies were ""lesbian"".  The Laides themselves denied this, and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual.  Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians.  We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past.\n\nIn previous eras in history, it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today. Indeed, same-gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship (but without any sexual content). This was known as ""romantic friendship"". However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is ""gay"" and what is ""straight"". In some ways, our modern society is very insecure in terms of sexuality."

Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a ""free pass"" when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi.

What's ""NOR""? I cannot read your mind. I don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about. I suggest, when in doubt stay away, or else violate the age old saying that ""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread"". (In Hebrew it's more blunt: hedyot kofetz berosh.)

I hope to see you around the project. \nMoldovan Song\nSurely notable if and only if the other Eurovision 2007 entries are?  \n\n Stub \n\nNice work ().  \n\nDiamond Management\n\nHi, you had put a notability tag on Diamond Management & Technology Partners.  I have updated the discussion page to show that the company is notable.  Once you get a chance to look at it, could you please remove the tag.  Also, I am not sure if you can do this, but would it be possible to move this article to ""Diamond Management & Technology Consultants""?  I got the name wrong when I first put it together.  Thanks!  \n\n Fight (song) \n\nI've removed the merger and notability tags from this article, as it placed in the top 10 (not 24th, as you've suggested to the anon who queried it) in the largest competitive music festival in the world. Precedent, furthermore, has been that any song performed onstage at ESC is eminently notable, due to the fact that it represented a country in an international competition. You're welcome to discuss this further on my Talk page if you want.  - Schreit mich an \n\n Belated agreement \n\nre: Your ole post in Template_talk:R_to_section\n\nMy gut feeling is that there is little substantive difference between Template:R from subtopic and Template:R to section.  What is unfortunate is the merger of concepts underlying Template:R from subtopic and Template:R with possibilities as it is a truism that almost all tolerated titles and named concepts have the possibility of becoming an article though there might be a very small probability of this taking place.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nChip Berlet's intentional holding back of article progress\nFar-left Hoxharian propagandist Chip Berlet is intentionally holding back the progress of the article, and recently removed information and work which took a very long time to build after going through numerous books which I own on the topic, he removed over 50 independent citations in a huge violation of WP:CENSOR, WP:EDIT, WP:OWN and WP:CITE to hold back information from the general public. Especially look at his vandalism of the ""Italian Fascism"" section. If Chip Berlet in a conflict of interest removes this information again I WILL report his intentional destruction as vandalism. \n\nI placed th {{underconstruction}} tag at the top of the page for a reason, he should embrace the progressing of the article and respect the concept of the tag instead of trollishly reverting hours and hours of work just because he, in this communist agenda ""doesn't like it"". Nobody has to ask the permission of Chip Berlet before working on the article and adding vertified information, you do not WP:OWN it or control who can contribute to it and you are not god. Here is what Chip Berlet would like to hold back from the general public who wish to learn about fascism (ie - the people who type ""fascism"" into wikipedia);\n\nA) what fascism is outside of boogieman cartoon depictions. Devotion to such anti-educational, anti-scholary stances on the part of Cberlet has already made this article decidedly inferior to every other encyclopedias coverage.\nB) that Fascism considered itself a Third Position on the political scale, not ""far right"", with its roots actually in defected members of the Italian Socialist Party (such as Mussolini himself) and anarchists such as the anarcho-syndicalists; not as berlet claims ""far rightists"". This is a particularly inconvient truth for Chip Barlet who depends on the presenation of fascism as right wing, so that in the United States he can attack followers of the Republican Party. Concepts irrelevent to the entire rest of the world. If fascism is not rightist, Berlet's world crumbles to dust. \nC) the history of fascism, how and why it came about after WWI (Treaty of Versailles, Italy's transition from regionalism to nationalism), what happened in practice, who its intellectuals were, what the Philosopher of Fascism Giovanni Gentile's reason and idea for opposing liberalism and democracy was; the latter is perhaps the most striking by modern considerations and the reader will be wanting to know ""why would these intellectuals think this?"".\nD) Berlet would like to build a collection of names of what fascism ""opposes"" and stack them all up in the intro. but he refuses to allow what it stands in support of and why; for example he removed the references to national syndicalism and corporativsm from the intro, absoutely essential pieces of this political system. He removed the reference to The Doctrine of Fascism and he removed the section which presents that it is hotlt disputed exactly which movements are and are not fascist apart from the National Fascist Party of Mussolini which is always called Fascist.\nE) once again, despite the discussion above with R-41 and myself. Berlet has, against consensus and against WP:CITE entered into the article that fascism is ""race"" and ""racial"" orientated, when it has been presented that it specifically is NOT the case and the majority of scholars do not take that line. As racialism belongs to Adolf Hitler's national socialism not all of fascism in general; some scholars such as Jewish writer A.F.K. Organski dispute whether National Socialism is Fascist at all. So to type that fascism is ""racially orientated"" in the intro is a complete and intentional deception, Berlet is well aware of this and his game is boooooring. That belongs in the intro of Nazism's article, as it already is there.\nF) Berlet would like to cover up the fact that the Fascist government under Benito Mussolini waged war on the Mafia, shattering the criminals into little pieces with Cesare Mori leading the way. This is again, an incredibly inconvenient truth for Barlet, because his democratic nation the United States openly collaborated with Lucky Luciano to invade Italy in the first place and then made previously jailed Mafiosi mayors of Sicilian towns after the conquest. \n\nG) maybe unrelated to Berlet (unless its his other name), but Bobisbob with his IP rather than username, has several times attempted to cover up that Adolf Hitler's movement is called ""National Socialism"" that is its full and correct title. I presume this editor is a socialist, who wants to distance the use of the word ""socialism"" from what Hitler called his movement. Well tough luck son you can't go back and rewrite

He later became a Roman Catholic. At no stage in his life was he Jewish, nor did he ever identify himself as Jewish. Please see the discussion pages and don't revert my edits. He was defined as Jewish by the Nazi Party, because they made the innovation of treating Jews as a race, not a religious community. Up until the early 20th century German Jews were regarded correctly as Germans. For Wikipaedia to succumb to a racial or genetic definition of Jewishness is highly contentious.

__label__non_toxic "\non the Creator\nThe demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from ""something"". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   \nOrthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the ""concept of God"" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.\n  "

__label__non_toxic No, I'm not a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office.  I'm not a member of the Mormon Church, either. Yet I have the right to feel offended when someone says every single Mormon man is a misogynist who sees every woman as a baby - making machine.  I have the right to defend law enforcement officers against the charge that their hard work consists of gossip.  Maybe they never solved the Kupcinet case, but their hard work has made the world safer for you and me and our parents.  If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.  Some make mistakes and commit crimes, but they are highly regarded by crime victims who get the satisfaction of seeing their tormentors get locked up.\n\nYou point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?\n\nWith your cockeyed logic, I can add a comment Richard Nixon made about Robert Kennedy's alleged relationship with Marilyn Monroe to the articles about Kennedy and Monroe, and anyone who adds a few words about Nixon's dishonesty can get banned from Wikipedia for 48 hours.  Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. \n\nLet gullible kids who read Wikipedia know what that great man said about an emotionally fragile woman he never met.  Your logic is cockeyed.  Unlike Monroe, whose autopsy was performed by a relatively competent doctor named Noguchi, Karyn Kupcinet was permanently screwed up by a klutz. Deal with it.  If you keep banning his klutzines, maybe you can delete the entire article about Jack Kevorkian. How do you know your body will be treated fairly the next time you visit a medical doctor ?  You don't.  If you're dead you don't complain.  Deal with it. Life sucks. People screw up everywhere, even in a room full of fresh corpses.

__label__non_toxic Jill Kristin McCormick is a fictional character made up mostly by Vedder himself and materially developed by Pearl Jam's PR machinery Vanderberg Communications managed by Nicole Vanderberg. The fact that McCormick's birth date was changed can prove a point that data for this article is arbitrarily written with no real verifiable data/source or document to support it. The person who poses for this personality is actually named Kathy Davis, a cousin of Eddie Vedder's, who also pretends to be his spouse but is actually the girlfriend of Pearl Jam fan club manager Tim Bierman. Also one needs to check the information on her children. They are not Vedder's but Bierman's. No reliable source supports the claim that Vedder is actually the father. This therefore makes the all of the information/details on this person with regards to this article questionable.

It's true I used a vandalism template, but because of the history of actual vandalism, and I also noted that there might be a good-faith purpose to the edit.

Hope to get the positive answer from your end  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \n\nClearly you are acting in good faith, attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health. Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or ""for the good cause of the women in India"" is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.\n\nYou should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)\n\n""Stayfree India"" has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   "

He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a ""fact"" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.\n\nKarataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. \n\nThis is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  \n\nIn prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]\n\nHe did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      \n\nHe escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]\n\nFollowing the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]\n\nfollowing police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.\n\nthis is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters."
__label__non_toxic "\n\n Examples of errors in this version \n\nThese are examples, not a comprehensive list. While typing it I had the very off-putting feeling that I had already done this several times, evidenced here. It hasn't worked with you, you're still unreasaonble, but I do it anyway for emphasis, and for the benefit of others. \n\n ""The term ""Arabic numerals"" is actually a misnomer""\n This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). \n\n ""... what are known in English as ""Arabic numerals"" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."", ""In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""\n What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.\n\n ""The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""\n Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, ""The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science ""the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"". According to Menninger (p. 400): ""This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land ""270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression ""50 wreaths of flowers"" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, ""Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.  \n\n ""However, it is

__label__non_toxic "\n\nI asked about sources out of curiosity, not to undermine what you said.  In a Jamaican context what you say is true - from what I cited (and some other reading) I would say that ""Taino"" is preferable to Arawak for the Greater Antilles because it is more specific in that context.  Taino is used specifically for the Arawakan people of the northern Caribbean - so it is a subset of the Arawakan people (and thus not interchangeable).  Taino could be considered a single ""tribe"" within the Arawakan language family.  The Island Caribs were another, as were the Lokono of the mainland.  The Arawakan language family is one of the largest in South America - Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and throughout the Caribbean.  The term Taino is not, to my knowledge, used for groups outside of the northern Caribbean.\nThe Arawakan people of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico had the most sophisticated cultures, the most powerful chiefdoms.  As far as I can tell, it is to these groups (the ""classic Taino"") plus their related neighbours (the ""eastern Taino"" and the ""western Taino"") that they name Taino applied.  The point is not the word as such, since it was probably not a word that they used for themselves except to proclaim themselves ""friendlies"" to the Spanish.  There was a distinct culture of the northern Caribbean...before I looked it up I though the Lucayans of the Bahamas were not part of that group, but I was wrong.  Words only work if they can be fit to real meaningful concepts.\nThe term ""Igneri"" has been used for the ""Island Arawaks"" who preceded the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles.  This group probably made up the basic substratum of the Island Carib population, and gave rise to the ""Kalinago"" (or women's language) of the Island Caribs.  The men spoke either a Carib language or a Carib-based pidgin, but apparently it had a lot of Arawak words.\nThe ""traditional"" view of the Island Caribs as interlopers has been severely questioned in recent times.  One source separated out three theories of their origin.  The traditional one (and the one I got in school, etc.) was the ""Carib replacement"" model - that the Caribs invaded and displaced the original Arawak population of the Lesser Antilles, and were spreading northward at the time of Spanish contact.  Another one is the ""Arawak continuity"" model which says that the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles acquired a Carib pidgin through trading with the Mainland Caribs.  The third is a reticulate model in which Mainland Caribs moved into the Lesser Antilles and merged with the Arawak population in a model comparable to the Norman conquest of England.  I got the impression that modern scholars leaned that way.  One source cited seventeenth century documents that refer to two groups of ""Caribs"" in Grenada, the Galini (probably Kaliña/Karinya, or Mainland Caribs) and the Caraïbes (Island Caribs).  In addition, contemporary sources refer to the Taino of the Greater Antilles fleeing Spanish massacres and joining the Island Caribs.  In the Spanish period the Island Caribs changed from being enemies of the Puerto Rican Tainos to being their allies against the Spanish.  (Main source: Raiders and Traders: Caraïbe Social and Political Networks at the Time of European Contact and Colonization in the Eastern Caribbean - Ann Cody Holdren, 1998, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA; McGinnis's dissertation - cited above - has a lot of quotes from Columbus's journals and from other contemporary sources).\nArawak (or aruaca), as I mentioned, comes from aru which was the Lokono word for cassava flour.  \nI am not a historian, just trying to do my best to see what the primary literature says.  The use of the word Taino is standard for the Greater Antilles, but whether it is ""accurate"" is another matter altogether.  McGinnis points out that Columbus was very selective in how he interpreted data - if you were hostile, then human limbs were proof you were Carib, but if you were friendly, then the heads he found in the village was funerary.  Of course the whole idea of the origin of the Caribs is controvertial.  But the traditional view is by no means accepted without question.  That's what makes history so exciting these days.   23:40, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)"

__label__non_toxic A tag has been placed on Stephanie Lael, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.\n\nFor guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

__label__non_toxic It is not clear as to which Edit created the sanction. Was it on the insistence of having the United States Marine Corps and Maj. Edwin Mclellan mentioned and hyperlinked more than on the actual page for Arman Manookian? If so, it has nothing to do with Armenia Azerbajan and thus the sanction unwarranted. Or, is it related to Monte Melkonian's page where the insistence is for a particular view by Marine Corps recruiters and historical departments to potray him as a terrorist in which case a discussion on body count and his accomplishments were proposed? Again, although I am assuming Good Faith, it is hard to get around the overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a coordinated effort to prevent Edits so to probogate a POV. I am trying very hard to escape that notion.

However if I wait for approval (especially as this is a stub and others may not happen along frequently) the update may take a long-time. I've placed some example images on the discussion page. Is this a case where I could update the page and then have it examined for potential contravention of policy? Better to get approval for such action first rather than after the fact! Thanks for ant help\n  \n\nPS: Until recently and for some time the wiki page also carried a link to my single topic web page about the memorial - I'm not so concerned about the possibility of adding this back in although that would I believe add to the wiki page (definitely for others to determine) but you'll see its generally the source of the material I'm proposing to place on wiki & has been of direct interest to families abroad with commemorated relatives."

__label__non_toxic "== Blood fetish ==\nRegarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:\n - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.\nUsing a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.\n\nInstead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    \n\nPeople just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) \n\nIt's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you ""I've never done anything like this before, either"". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   \n\nHmm I guess that makes sense, kinda\n\nI would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for ""assortative mixing"" and ""risk tolerance"" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)\n\nI'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying ""X does Y"" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   \n\nKarada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   \n\nIt's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation.

__label__non_toxic "Harassment ==\nAs I read the Wikipedia guidelines, Harassment is regarded as far worse than any perceived COI. To quote ""to make the target feel threatened or intimidated, and the outcome may be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to discourage them from editing entirely."" - which is exactly how I feel. \n  \n\n COI \nThis is my statement\nWhen I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said ""how would I like to be an associate of the company""  and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI.\n  \n\n Liquid Nitrogen \n\nI am sorry, but I do not see your point in removing my edit.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \n\nCOI\nwhatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this ""policy"" seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. \nAnyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit!   \n\nStange Behaviour By Editor McGeddon\nI am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge. He must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence. Regards Thandi Moyo (nee Zambo)

__label__non_toxic " 2005 (UTC)\n\nThis periodization of Proto-Slavic (PS) is not generally accepted. However, most scholars agree that the PS period lasted for 2,000 years or so. It is impossible that the language would not have been changing for so long. That is why reconstructed forms labelled ""Proto-Slavic"" are very various indeed (*supnas, *supnu, *sunu and *sъnъ ('a dream' or 'sleeping') can all be termed Proto-Slavic). There is not even the agreement when the period ended. Some give even 600 AD as the final date (after which individual languages existed), others say that OCS (ca. 850 AD) was still a literary form of the latest Proto-Slavic (of course, with strong dialectal, local features). And there do not seem to be any real basics for any periodization of PS. Specialists argue even on relative chronology of some language phenomena (inc. phonetic changes, for example some would see the sequence -as > -us > -uš > -u > -ъ, i.e. first changing and losing of -s, next vowel reduction, while others would assume -as > -us > -ъs > -ъ, i.e. first vowel reduction, then loss of final consonants). And to say nothing of the absolute chronology!\n\nThe situation is even more complicated when we took into consideration that most of the literature on the subject is not English and the authors use terms which are not strict renderings for English Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic. In fact, in Slavic languages there exists the term praslavyanski (or silmilar) where pra- means the same as great in great grandfather (= praded or similar). This term should be translated as Old Slavic then. Besides, the term protoslavyanski (=Proto-Slavic) refers - at least in some sources - to the early period of the Slavic language commonwealth (less or more, equal to Schenker's EPS). and finally, the (Russian) term obshcheslavyanski ('Common Slavic', Polish ogólnosłowiański with the same meaning) refers to features which are present in each modern Slavic language rather than to their common ancestor.\n\nAnyway, I see no reasons for keeping two different articles, one on Proto-Slavic, the other for Common-Slavic, whatever these terms mean.\n\n 12:18, 13 August"

__label__non_toxic Article needs to be split into two\n\nThere are two different things going on in this article: one is a hypothetical discussion of what a North American currency union might look like, based on descriptions in obscure white papers from think tanks and science fiction books. The other is the origin and debunking of the conspiracy theory that such a union actually is being planned by some sort of powerful forces. The two have little to do with each other, for one. Additionally, by keeping the two in one article, the citations for the first look like evidence for the latterwhich they are not, and which some of the people who provide them probably do not want them used as. The first article should be the place for discussing serious economic and futurologist viewpoints about what an NACU might be; the second should be devoted largely to a sociological analysis of why people believe in the conspiracy theorynot to details of the theory itself, as that lends undue weight to the idea that said theory is true. I suggest that the two articles be: North American currency union (concept in literature) and North American currency union (conspiracy theory).

__label__non_toxic However one must understand that there are many intelligent africans and many dumb europeans.  There is only a difference in the frequency of what you can find.  As to the flynn effect, it has been surmised by others that the I.Q. increases are due to better nutrition.  People today are much taller than they were a hundred years ago and have a larger brain size.  This change is solely due to better nutrition.  It has been shown in many studies the nutritional deficienciess can lower I.Q..  However, having a higher i.q. means that you can get better nutrition for your child and thus add even more i.q. points.  So africa's average I.Q. of around 70 is lower than it's potential as evidenced by american blacks who have an I.Q. of about 85.  However this is probably the upper limit as to what african blacks could achieve since there is significant white admixture in american black populations.  Studies of adopted children have shown that asian children tend to have I.Q.'s significantly greater than their adoptive parents (110)  while black children have I.Q.'s that are lower than their adoptive parents (90).  So evidence points to the I.Q. gap being at least partially genetic.

Nice try (I'm being kind) but do you really believe that portraying a £720,000 EU grant for researching new ways of thickening several food products, including yoghurt, as ""£700,000 to stop yoghurt going runny"" is as much of a misrepresentation as the way you mischaracterised Britain's 1939 declaration of war? No, of course you don't. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of the yoghurt thing (and many other examples) as being any kind of misrepresentation, but the Commission certainly does, else such stories wouldn't be on its many lists of ""myths"", so I have to assume that you and other Wikipedians are being sincere when you see misrepresentation where I see only (justifiable) disrespect and ingratitude.\n\nSo let's start from the bottomthe top. The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that ""Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts"". Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.\n\nNow, that's certainly the way the word is used by a very large number of people. Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.\n\nSo the article is wrong to start as it does.

__label__non_toxic There is a difference between making personal attacks and correcting disinformation. The worst of which I can be accused is attempting to correct disinformation, sometimes a bit impatiently. (On the other hand, when editors of the CTMU article were falsely and maliciously accused of forging source material - that is, personally attacked, and repeatedly - nobody said a word, and no moderator lifted a finger. Clearly, something's not right there.) Regarding the Mega Society, I'm afraid you're on your own. I'm not interested in it or its Wikipedia article. If it is associated with Langan or the CTMU, that may well be a shame...but if the truth be told, probably more so for Langan and the CTMU than the Mega Society itself. (If there's anything else I can help you with, just let me know.)

__label__non_toxic Now I believe you are done Sophia, congrats.  I will ping User:Ponyo and User:Anthony Bradbury, to see if we need to do anything more, or be told anything more.  \n Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?  \n As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures. \n Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.  \n I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.  \n But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.  \n Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.  \n On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.  \n This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.  \n She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.  \n Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?  And also, I understand that it is customary to let cleansed-usernames tidy up their old userpages and their old usertalkpages, if they wish; can she archive all this info here into the page-edit-history, should she wish?  Thanks for your help and guidance getting Sophia back up and working.  75.108.94.227

__label__non_toxic Issues \nWell, I am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic.  The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100. I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some, and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia.  I believe that enough discussion has occurred here, as per their request, to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article, alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming.  If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own, as a supposedly fair, balanced, and factual encyclopedia, I will have to boycott further use of this resource, because it's no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts.  Wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single-sided position of this article, for one my own addition.  Therefore, wikipedia, I request once again that this information be added and it's evidence for that sited, WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT DEMEANING LANGUAGE, in this article, as this is only fair and factual.  My previous changes are on file and I would not mind them being replaced.  The controversary section isn't enough because it's language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views.  I don't have a problem with calling global warming a fact, I simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea.  Just because Al Gore thinks we're headed for death doesn't make it so, as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn't make it true.  I remind you that plenty of action groups, left wing radical groups and individuals, non-existant scientists, and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming, and therefore, I want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn't mean everyone who does isn't credible.  You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it, but 1 that agrees with GW, he makes the front page.  Anyway, I come down hardest on wikipedia because they're the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its' integrity is maintained, and there they have failed in my opinion. Borghuman\n\nSee Wikipedia:Undue weight - although I personally have no problem with mentioning that there are people willing to deny facts, it's on about the same level as ignoring claims of people who still believe the earth is flat. A mention would do no harm, however. -
__label__non_toxic "::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your ""proof"" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own ""proof"" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154  \n\n"

__label__non_toxic Separation of personal life from main 'eras' section \nThe separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings. The eras are tiny, and any reader will be confused by the layout, which isn't chronological. So that's why I'm trying to reach a new consensus: To put the personal life information back into the chronological part of the article.

__label__non_toxic Extinction in North Atlantic \n\nDespite what countless secondary sources that didn't bother do their research say, there is zero evidence (none) that whalers caused the extinction of gray whales in the North Atlantic. This is just another stupid assumption made again and again by lazy researchers. We don't know why they went extinct. We know they were hunted off Iceland, perhaps New England (iirc), and perhaps elsewhere (the Basques were at least aware of them c. 1611). We don't know the historic size of that population, how long they were hunted, how many were caught per year, or the composition (sex, age) of the catch. Do not restore my revert until you find proof (not circumstantial evidence, e.g. increase in whaling activity on entirely different species coincided with the disappearance of the gray whale in the North Atlantic) that whaling was the cause of the extinction of Atlantic gray whales (good luck with that, because you won't find it).

__label__non_toxic "\n\nWhile diglossia as a field of research or even the concept might have flowered long past Caldwell, its quite inconceivable that Caldwell would have been unaware of this diglossia.  Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.\n\nBe that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.\n\nNotwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.\n\nso, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... ""....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""\n\nAnd, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -\n\nWhile I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.\n\nAny literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  \n\nWith Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.\n\nIn general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.\n "

__label__non_toxic Algr, you are committing a fundamental fallacy here. You made reference to the fact that people make their computations on a calculator or computer, which, you correctly point out, does not use the system of real numbers. This has nothing to do with any preference for an alternative number system, and everything to do with the limitations of the underlying electronics. When engineers built their various systems of arithmetic, they were not promoting their's as superior, but rather theirs was intended to be used as a close approximation to a mainstream mathematical number system. The floating point and double precision floating point numbers are supposed to be approximately real numbers. The unsigned and signed integers are approximations for the actual integers. etc.

__label__non_toxic Question about WikiProject South Carolina \n\nGreetings, I have been watching WikiProject South Carolina for a while and it doesn't appear to be very active and I had a proposition for the members to consider. I would like to pull WPUS under WikiProject United States to some degree. I am not necessarily talking a full merger unless thats what the members of WPSC want but here is what I mean.\nThe project would stay the way it is except for a couple things. I would like to replace  with  and add WPSC to the list of Projects supported by WPUS. This would include replacing the WPSC template on the talk pages of the articles with WPUS/South Carolina (if you want to see an examply you camn look at Washington DC).\nI would also add it to the list of Projects supported by WPUS on the main WPUS landing page.\nThis would do a couple things that I think would benefit both projects.\nIt would increase visibility of South Carolina and related articles to a much larger user base\nIt would allow WPSC to more easily benefit from the Bots running for WPUS. This includes article alert bot that warns of Articles and Images for deletion or Promotion. This would ensure maximum visibility if an article relating to South Carolina was submitted for deletion or promotion.\nIt would allow the South Carolina related articles to fall under the WPUS and South Carolina scope.\nIt would somewhat reduce the maintenance required by consolidating the templates\nIt would reduce the number of templates visibile on the articles\nIn addition to the above, I typically cycle through all the articles in the WPUS scope every month or 2 fixing various things (sections, typos, persondata, categories, etc) and this would allow the South Carolina articles to fall under that much more easily.\nPlease let me know what thoughts or ideas you have about this and if the other members would be receptive to this. I also added a message to the talk page of WikiProject South Carolina. Thanks in advance.

__label__non_toxic "\n\n I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.\n\n We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as ""OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""\n\n I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.\n\n There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an ""inside account"" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk "

__label__non_toxic "EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED, ANDREW. Coursed instruments are referred to as ""COURSED"", 5-COURSED, not ""10-string"". You seek to raise the IGNORANCE of manufacturers of folk and rock instruments to a virtue, to a new musicological convention. The centuries-old academic convention that obviously predates rock musicians maintains that a pair of strings is termed a course and instruments with courses are named for their number of COURSES. You ""convention"" you mention that contradicts this is nothing more than ignorance you wish to dress up as something more. \n\nTell me, Andrew Alder (church drummer and rhythm guitarist who has never in his life played an actual ""ten-string guitar""), if you notate music for a coursed instrument, do you write 12 or 10 separate lines in tablature? NO. You write one per course, which is in practical musical effect one string. If you write it in musical notation (can you even read this??? I doubt highly), would you use numbered circles up to 10 or 12 for each so-called individual string? NO! You would notate the first two strings as a circled number 1, the second pair of strigns as a circled 2, the 5th and 6th strings as a circled number 3, etc. These instruments are COURSED! For all practical purposes these instruments are NOT ""ten-string guitars"" (with the hypen) a term that has come to signify a specific instrument, an instument you are obscuring and confusing by introducing misinformative garbage.

Both are keen on the rules, as long as the rule at that moment applies to them, I.E. Be Bold allows BMK to change any photo he wants and allows him, to craft in moments a consensus, with his posse behind him. What I found amusing about that user is his ref to WP:DIVA, yet when you read DIVA, it really should a lot like how he handles himself here. His POV is the ONLY POV that matters and his passive aggressive POV pushing, dominates the topics he edits, and the user refuses to obtain unbiased comments from others as was noted in this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJersey_City%2C_New_Jersey&diff;=641043036&oldid;=641042701 Beyond My Ken, pretends to want others to offer insight as long as he can posture his POV by dissuading from voting on anything I contribute, and talking himself into thinking that other support his POV, 5 minutes later then just executing the edit. That is not a consensus, that is a dictator and abusive way to control and dominate anything he decides to Dominate. Epicgenius, NeilN, Castncoot, are followers for the most part. I think it is really funny that Epicgenius was the one that selected the Manhattan photo for the lead on that page, then goes back and tells me ""do not replace lead photos anymore"", but I guess it is still ok for them to do so, without any substantiation of the contributions. I do not think that ""Epicgenius"" knows what he is doing here yet, and his talk page somewhat supports that assertion. Castncoot like a picture of a bridge for the lead photo of a city, as that bridge is ""Iconic"" in spite of the fact that icons are not cities, my contribution was to create a page that was about the topic city, not leading with the bridge that gets you there. The photo I changed out was actually the real city, not the bridge going to it. After over 5 years, I have had only a few run ins with other editors. I have hundreds of lead photos and a number of Featured ones too. I have been bold in my editing, as BMK claims that allows him to dominate topics, and 99% of my photos are NEVER removed or replaced until someone decides to go off the deep end, as BMK and APK did here. lastly aerial photography is highly valued and extremely difficult, as the collective combination of skills required is overwhelming at times. No other editor on this site has contributed the type of content that I used to submit. Now that BMK has made it clear that he will stalk my edits and revert any photographic contribution I make, what is the point of continuing other then to just edit stories here, as I have for years and perhaps Wikipedia can one day find another aerial photographer that is willing to donate to the site.

__label__non_toxic "=Not using ""Palestine"" or ""Palestinian"" for Talmud and rabbis to avoid confusion===\n\nNote: Many articles about the rabbis of the Talmud and Mishnah are derived from the archaic Jewish Encyclopedia, published between 1901-1906, over one hundred years ago (when the Middle East was still under the thumb of the Ottoman Turks) and which used the archaic expressions ""Palestine"" when referring to the Land of Israel, and to the Jews living in the areas of the historical Land of Israel as ""Palestinians."" This is a big mistake that requires constant attention and correction, especially when copying and editing articles from the Jewish Encyclopedia or from similarly archaic sources such as Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897). At this time, no-one uses the term/s ""Palestinian/s"" (in relation to anything associated with Jews or the land they lived in and which they regarded as their homeland) nor by any type of conventional Jewish scholarship, particularly at the present time when the label ""Palestinian"" is almost entirely identified with the Palestinian Arabs who are mostly Muslims. Finally, kindly take note that the name Palestinian Talmud is also not used and it redirects to the conventional term Jerusalem Talmud used in Jewish scholarship. Thank you.  \n\n=="

__label__non_toxic Sorry for not replying, MH - I did not see anything further I could say there that would advance towards a solution. My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments. I think I disagree with both Ikip and Ludwigs2 more often than I agree, but they in particular have made good comments.\n\n HJM - I would be happy to see you (or anyone) open a neutrally worded mediation discussion with the aim of reducing the adversarial atmosphere, but the venue needs to be appropriate to the issues. Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct. There have already been a number of RS/N, NPOV/N, and BLP/N discussions of related issues that could probably be exhumed for background. I have some hope, though, that the recent infusion of fresh blood might work out a solution without escalation.\n\n That said, I would not close the discussion you propose - the strength of the collaborative editing model lies in seeking and acting on consensus rather than acceding to the rationations and whims of any single editor. - 2/0 (cont.)

Another brother Brad, who is a physician, spoke to the coroner on the phone, and felt that the coroner had actually not been able to determine the cause of death.  The coroner's report made no mention of cirrhosis or of ""walking pneumonia"" although I too heard several people comment that they had heard that ""walking pneumonia"" was the cause.  I suspect that someone mis-heard ""bronchopneumonia"" as ""walking pneumonia"".\n\nThere are two pieces of evidence that suggest that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning.  I made the identification of Malcolm's remains at the morgue in Chicago and when I did so I noticed that he had an unusual red skin color.  At the time I was unaware of how this might have arisen but it was so striking that I did comment on it to a number of acquaintances.  I learned later that this skin color is characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning.  In addition, the person in whose apartment Malcolm was sleeping that night described to me several days later that leaking gas from the space heater in the apartment had been discovered on the morning after Malcolm's death; that the gas company had been called and that the gas had been turned off until the problem could be fixed.  The danger from such gas is due to the possibility of explosion, and to the toxic carbon monoxide it contains.- "

I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint. \n\n==

__label__non_toxic "\n\n Pris and Racheal are the same android \n\nI'm afraid this is going to be quite a useless comment at the moment, because I don't have the book in front of me to quote from.\n\nHowever I came to this Wikipedia article originally to see if it could help me decide whether Pris and Rosen are in fact the same android (not just the same model).  The article makes no mention whatsoever of something that has really been puzzling me.\n\nWhy do I think that Racheal and Pris might be one and the same:\n\n- Pris originally introduces herself as Racheal Rosen when meeting JR Isidore and then changes her mind and calls herself Pris (if Pris is simply using her name for cover how do she know her?)\n- Deckard says that Racheal and Pris have the same eyes (in fact the only difference he notes are clothes)\n- We hear no more from Racheal after Pris has been killed (I'm assuming there she killed the goat before she went over to the conapt building)\n- When Pris runs towards Deckard before she dies her last words are along the lines of ""For all we meant to each other.""  Surely they don't know each other at all; Pris and Deckard have never met if she is someone else.\n-  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it - i.e. she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the Andys\n- Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android, it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nFirst, NPOV is only violated by you. Why do you say ""of course"" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's ""of course"". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while ""Euroscepticism"" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be ""Eurocriticism"" or ""Anti-EUism"") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information.

What is the correct spelling of Shayeste Khan?\n\nThere seems to be inconsistency on how this name is rendered in English characters. I also found Shaista Khan in Shivaji .\n\n3. Could someone confirm that Killedar means a garrison commander?\n\nOr if it doesn't correct it.\n\n4. I assume (from context) that Durga also means fort or maybe  a fortified town. \n\nIs that correct? But see current article Durga .\n\n5. We're missing article for Sangram Durga, or maybe we're missing an article for Sangram and an expansion of  Durga \n\n6.

__label__non_toxic Howie Payne \n\n Hi  Keith D\n\nI would like to protest the changes made by user 92.8.22.187 and subsequent locking of the page by yourself thus protecting his recent subbmissions\nI have reverted the changes revisions made by this user several times due to lack of references and dubious POV  submissions.\nThe user was contacted and referred via previous talk message pages to point out & explain this but despite this continued to revise the page without providing references for the changes submitted. \nAs you have now locked the page with these incorrect/unreferenced submissions in place I would implore you to re evaluate the submissions made by user 92.8.22.187 and act accordingly.\n\nI will go into detail here in the hope it may help resolve some the issues with the edits submitted by  user 92.8.22.187:\n\n I see no reason to now have 4 references to support the spelling of a name that has not been contested. - One of which is a pay site and another that contains a personal address!\nUser 92.8.22.187 claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here. \n The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication  (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance. \n Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference \n Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001)  \n The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like  which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look  campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 http://www.gigwise.com/news/6615/Luke-Thomson-Leaves-The-Stands and was replaced by Paul Molloy. \nThe Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user 92.8.22.187 has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact.\nRegarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference. \nThere is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott.\nI do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user 92.8.22.187 has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case\n \nI hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information.\n\nThe previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

While the terms are often confused, plagiarism and copyright infringement are not the same thing. Copyright infringement occurs when copyrighted content is used without permission in a way that violates the copyright holder's exclusive right; adequate credit does not efface infringement. Similarly, public domain content is plagiarized if used without acknowledging the source, even though there is no copyright issue. This guideline addresses when copying and close paraphrasing may not be a problem, how to avoid plagiarism when there is a risk, and how to address it when it is encountered."" (citation)\n\nWikipedia copyright issues stats that\n\n""However, material copied from sources that are not public domain or compatibly licensed without the permission of the copyright holder (unless brief quotation used in accordance with non-free content policy and guideline) is likely to be a copyright violation. Even inserting text copied with some changes can be a copyright violation if there's substantial linguistic similarity in creative language or structure(this can also raise problems of plagiarism). Such a situation should be treated seriously, as copyright violations not only harm Wikipedia's redistributability, but also create legal issues."" (citation)\n\nBoth is not given.

__label__non_toxic Unbalanced \n\nThis article appears very biased.  It reads as if the goal was to present this man as a complete quack, and with that goal in mind, only sources which supported that viewpoint were sought out.  More concerning are the instances of improperly referenced content.  Only had time to look at refs from opening paragraph, but already found multiple examples of content not supported by the refs attached to it.  It was claimed Mercola is an “alternative medicince proponent”, but reference only briefly mentions that Mercola was involved in a lawsuit with someone who apparently happens to be a critic of alternative medicine.  This doesn’t exactly make Mercola an “alternative medicine proponent”.  The alternative medicine WP says alternative medicine is not based on evidence or scientific method. Mercola is an Osteopathic Physician which is research field requiring training similar to that of MD’s.   In the first paragraph, it was also claimed he was a member of several alternative medicine organizations, with no reference supporting this claim.

__label__non_toxic "\n\nIf you are too lazy and full of yourself to do so then I will just post the relevant sections here:\n\nPaglia: On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism. \n\nCamille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ""traditional"" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ""respectable"" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large."

Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, ""Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.""\n3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution. While this may appear to be in the interests of NPOV, the reality is that the actual evidence for evolution is so hugely overwhelming, that to give an impression of equal validity is itself a bias point. Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article. I accept that an argument putting forward the 'credentials' of creationism is fair and should be included, but the argument against it should not be tamed in to give the ostensible appearance of neutrality.  17:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)"

__label__non_toxic Alternative terms\nThough one user proposes protosequel as it was more a correct term  , the main meaning of the proto- prefix is first. Thus, the clearer meaning of protosequel would be first sequel (i. e. the protosequel of Star Wars might be The Empire strikes back, while its prequels are The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Siths). the last versions of this article presented the  protosecuela as a Spanish term. While neither prequela, presecuela nor protosecuela are listed in Real Academia's dictionaries, precuela is far more frequently used than the proposed alternatives, as can be found by a simple google search, or by searching it in the Real Academia Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual which presents two instances of precuela and one of precuelas, while there are none of the alternative proposals.

Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk ""\n\nYes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?\n\nBUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?\n\nLet's look at your odd writing style: ""If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"" Just what are you going for there?\n\nI've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.\n\nYour threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.\n\nNow, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.\n\nLet's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a ""separate but equal"" or ""separate and unequal"" system?\n\nThe admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?\n\nThe fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.\n\nTo recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.\n\nNow let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?\n\nPersonal life\n\nRomero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]\n\nRomero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.\n\nRomero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a ""confirmed bachelor."" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.\n\nRomero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: ""Butch."" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: ""You're so butch!"" While Romero's homosexuality was an ""open secret"" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.\n\nRomero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood

Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on?

I'm really not comfortable with even the existence of the article but haven't had the energy to do the research to prove it's not really a named region. Does anyone ever refer to Southeastern Oregon as a separate entity from Eastern Oregon? It's linked from the article about the current situation at Malheur, but I'm not sure we're doing our readers a service linking to that vs. linking to Eastern Oregon. On the one national radio story about it that I was paying attention to, they said the events were taking place in Eastern Oregon, which seems like enough precision for the casual readerthat is they need to know that it is the rural, conservative part of the state in contrast to Western Oregon. I'm not planning to wade into this until the situation has died down, but I'm curious what you and other WikiProject Oregon folks think about even having a Southeastern Oregon article. It's not like we have Northwestern Oregon, Southwestern Oregon or Northeastern Oregon articles. There's a distinction between vague compass directions vs. commonly named regions such as Eastern Oregon and Central Oregon (one point the Malheur article claimed that Burns was in Central Oregon) and Southern Oregon. And of course don't get us started on the Oregon Coast (or was that Oregon coast...

__label__non_toxic No offence taken. I actually found your comment quite amusing.
__label__non_toxic "Thank you Joseph2302. I'll be very sincere with you. I have been a full time article writer, blogger and web content writer. I also earn a living from that. I work on freelancer.com, Elance.com and odesk.com..  \n\nHere's my public profile on freelancer.com   -   https://www.freelancer.com/u/hilumeoka2000.html\n\nHere's my public profile on Elance.com  -   https://www.elance.com/s/hilumeoka2000/\n\nYou can also search ""hilumeoka2000"" in Odesk to get my details there.\n\nNow, I use to see  clients post jobs about ""Write a Wikipedia page""  or ""Create a Wikipedia page"" on all the freelancer platforms. In fact, it seems as if everyone wants to be on wikipedia probably because of the high page ranking and traffic that comes from the resource. \n\nAs a freelancer interested in research, I use to get useful materials from Wikipedia and other sources to write some of my articles.  Indeed, Wikipedia has been a great resource.\n\nSometime in 2002, I created an account on wikipedia to see if I can meet the demands of the clients who request for wiki job on freelance platforms. To be frank, I didn't understand how to use wikipedia as at then. Hence, I abandoned the urge to write wikipedia articles and continued with my normal web content development and article writing career.\n\nNow, sometime in April this year, I decided to start placing bids on wikipedia jobs via freelancer.com.  This is because, wiki jobs are always available but there are few people who actually know how to write them.\n\nI made a decision to learn about wikipedia writing and what it entails. I started reading all the wiki tutorials I could see on wikipedia.  I started learning and indeed, it's quite interesting.  It was not easy initially, but, I vowed to know more.\n\nSo, I placed my first bid  on freelancer.com. A client wanted me to write on ""Joshua Letcher"" . I accepted. I used this particular topic to learn some facts about wiki policies.  I created and submitted it for review. It was rejected but I was told what to do to make it acceptable. I took some days to make some researches about ""Joshua Letcher"" I discovered, there are no media secondary resources.. That was the reason the article was deleted.\n\nNow, the same client also contracted me to write about thier company ""Newfield Resources Ltd. I did my research to get some secondary resources. I succeeded and created the article. It was allowed to stay.\n\nSo, I got excited. I really became very happy that I can now write wikipedia articles. So, I went for more.  I always focused more on maintaining neutrality and using secondary sources. I also follow the rules on referencing and formatting having taken enough time to learn them.\n\nNow, as a freelancer, I kept getting alerts about new Wikipedia  creation jobs. I  go ahead to place my bids.  I really got selected by some clients to help them put up a wikipedia page.  I also get paid for doing so as a freelancer. I turn down jobs that do not have media coverage or jobs that are meant to promote or advertise since they are against wiki rules.\n\nSo far, I've created the following pages via the jobs I won through freelancer.com and Elance.com. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Direct\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kumar_Kalotee \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfield_Resources_Limited \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Concern_Welfare_Society\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawano_Kambeu\n\nI made sure each of the pages is  neutral and properly cited. I'm also working on few more pages right now. I don't get involved in vandalism or supporting stands to make a page stay on wikipedia. My main focus is to create new pages.\n\nTo be very sincere with you, I've never heard about the issue of disclosing paid identity on Wikipedia until now. I thought that I'm free to create articles as a freelancer and get paid.\n\nI noticed one thing about most of my clients. They don't know how to create articles on wikipedia. Some of them have tried but failed. Hence, they look for an expert who will help them.\n\nSo please, I'll like to know if I'm contravening wiki rules by creating articles for clients through freelancer.com.  I don't really know. There are lots of policies on wikipedia. I learn most of them as I create articles. I learn virtually on daily basis. \n\nDo I need to declare myself as a Paid editor or something?  Do I need to stop creating articles for clients? \n\nI'll like to get clarifications. \n\nThanks   \n\n"

__label__non_toxic "\n\n The Cramp Twins \n\nThe Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).\n\nSeason one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.\nSeason 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.\nThe show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka ""Tokyo Mew Mew"") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.\n\n Main characters \n Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is ""Girlpants"", but he sometimes calls Lucien a ""nerd"". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. \n Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo

The reason for the block was due to the addition of external links into multiple articles that seemed to violate the guideline at WP:EL and the policy at WP:NOT#REPOSITORY; however, I believe these were good faith additions and that you were not aware of the site linkspam guidelines and policies.  Although, at this point you should avoid re-adding the external links until discussions take place about their appropriateness.

__label__non_toxic Cetainly there seems to be a few 'sins of omission' from this post.  I have no particular axe to grind with the ACLU, but on reading some of the comments on this discussion page I noticed one that said the founder was a Communist.  Clearly this is important information, as the ACLU was formed at a time when Communism was considered the pinnacle of anti-patriotism in America.  It certainly coloured my view of the organisation, and I feel it would help to bring an insight into its formation.  Yet this is not mentioned in the article.  Surely this is pertinent, given the progressive, almost anarchic, political leanings of the organisation past and present?  I have to say, from a neutral's point of view (I'm from the UK, so the ACLU does not affect me one way or the other), I'm beginning to feel that this is not a neutral article.  It's leaving out facts that I would like to know about.

Youve been here reverting my changes for a week.\n\nYou had a hunch that smth changed. Thats it. And you allow yourself to change this article. NOT WRITE IT, CHANGE IT. So there are 2 editors who said they are playable, and you as 1 person are still right.\nIn a mean time, before i managed to reply you, smbdy else already changed hawkeye and spideman back. So, now there are 3 of us. Will you change it again?\n\nFurthermore, you asked me to give you a proof, and i posted an ss. Now you are questioning validity of that, and my candour with it. Then why you bothered to ask me in a first place?! Because you are bored? Im not. Really am not.\nAnd there are not more of you, there is only you. I am not explaining this to other readers or editors, nobody in this argument but you and me. There are other ppl editing this, they wouldve joined so far if they wanted. Stop using plural. \nIs hulk a bot in this picture?! Really?! Have you even played the game? And when you 'did' play, how many times your champ was on the right side in the battle?? Try to think before coming after someones integrity. Or just try to think. Anyplace. Anytime.\n\nNo, that is not my spiderman. Like a reasonable, logical being, after i seen that someone changed this article here, i asked my ally if they have one of the champs, and if they could try to play 1v1 with them. Only few people didnt sell those 1*s in my ally, but luckily one of them few had 2 of those and he sent me ss, which i posted here.\nBut being an awesome mate and even better human being, even i asked for only one ss, he sent me few of them ss1  ss2 ss3  ss4, apologized for late wolverine ss, and asked if i needed it better. I said no, cause i thought im dealing with a normal person. Honest mistake.\n\nIve done my elaborations. With even one ss, your whole theory falls, i really dont have to prove the others. That Thor i never seen, never heard about him, so i think its normal i never mentioned it, nor have i ever changed anything about him. Do try to contact kabam about that as well.\n\nNow, im done writing to you. If you gonna ask for another ss, to prove every champ you think doesnt exist, exists, then you know where you can go.\nI think ive proven more than i need, especially since i had to prove innocence in a first place. Meanwhile, ill keep changing it until i get blocked. Then im done with editing ever, ill die of heart attack before 40.\nAuf wiedersehen, my french friend, hope you have a very lucky, lucky life.

__label__non_toxic You know what, since the last exchange Oakster has clarified a source on the page, and he has also reverted you. Make the argument with him, or take it to the project page. \nThe sources clearly show the following; The Triple Crown was defined with Pedro Morales WWF title, WWF IC, WWF Tag. Then HBK expanded it to GSC, to include the Euro. Then Kurt Angle expanded it to include the SD Tag titles. Then HBK and HHH expanded it to include the WHC. So Tier 1 (WHC, WWE) Tier 2 (TT and SD TT) Tier 3 (IC not US) and Tier 4 (Euro). Then Kane expanded it to include HC on Tier 4. If anyone has any combination of those seven titles then they are a Grand Slam Champion. Even if tomorrow WWE.com were to announce the TCC and GSC never happened it would not change a thing. \nThe point about Benoit is that WWE.com is not 100% reliable. They do change their minds (did the Rockers ever beat the Hart Foundation, no for about a decade then yes once Bret Hart left and they rewrote history). AT the moment the WWE do not acknowledge the existence of the 2004 RR winner, so does this mean we erase it from Benoit's article? No. The expanded definition for the GSC and TCC still stand, and as HBK never even wrestled for WWF/WWE while the HC title was active I have no idea why his bio would ever talk about the HC title. (He was retired from March 1998 to SummerSlam 2002 the exact length of time the HC title was active.) \nIf you have a problem with my revert then gain consensus for your view of the events, at the project talk page or ask Oakster why he agreed with my revert.
__label__non_toxic Hi, thanks for the pony. Yeah, let me look at uploading the stuff to Wikicommons. Note that there really is no way to prove when any photo was ever published for the first time.

__label__non_toxic Oppose.  There is a reason to use his name - it is the name of the person discussed in the article.

A cursory glance of the history of Islamic states will reveal a lot of emirs, greater and lesser, named Abd al-Qadir.  What you are proposing is akin to renaming James I of England to simply King James, simply because some local things are named after him (e.g. King James Bible).

I said, ""I clearly understand that the GPS navigation equations consist of n (n greater than 3) equations for the surfaces of n spheres and that the solution of these n equations consists of a clock bias and a point at the intersection of these n sphere surfaces"".

__label__non_toxic And you have a point in return, and a dilemma with which to grapple.  But to my mind, it still doesn't justify the excess length, especially given the level of detail present in one section as opposed to the others.  \n\nI might also suggest that one newspaper article is proof of nothing, despite some rather emphatic insistence it is.  Newspapers have editorial standards and biases of their own.  Consequently, we're left to determine the veracity of individual quotes, and have no way of knowing evidence was omitted from the article in order to paint a specific picture.  The implication I draw from earlier comments is that what Irvine says is not true (unless he's admitting he lied) and everyone else is truthful. Yet even a cursory glance through the comments accompanying the article and associated material in the same publication indicates one of the other major parties involved has a pretty dicey history herself.  I'd say hanging the word proof on any of what you have is pretty questionable absent a second reliable source of evidence (i.e.: not another entity that has picked up and recycled the original source article.)

__label__non_toxic List of common misconceptions\n\nI feel your behaviour on this matter is bordering on inappropriate, specifically that you are assuming an authority on dictating procedure that is not in any way supported by policy.   Swordfish made that revert on the basis of wanting reliable sourcing (he had not followed the wikilinks included in the added text to see that the point is more than adequately sourced and not at all controversial); I directed him to those sources and he has made no objection to my reintroducing the content so far.  The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.\n\nThis was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.  If you decide that you have issue with the sources in question, how they should be referenced, or the content itself, fine I urge you to open a talk page discussion on it.  However, if you continue to meddle and revert my content again on no other basis than trying to enforce your preferred procedure, clearly an administrator will have to straighten the matter out.

__label__non_toxic If the KLA had a Tactical Victory, they would've completed their strategic goal, if they had a Decisive Victory, they would've killed almost all the Yugoslav Army troops, but the truth is, they have killed around 50 or 30 or 45 Yugoslav Troops. Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is, that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia, Greece, and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved, but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1, F-16 2, and AC-130 2), I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used, but didn't inflict casualties, but for the F-16, I believe inflicted casualties 8.

Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a ""racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all.

To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike.\nI have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it.\nThats why he hurried to deleet them.\nBut you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!!\nthen after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column.\nBut it isn't at all what happened.\nMy answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users.\nThey have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside.\nYou don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case.\nAs for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for.\ni do not think that an aristrocats fan is welcome in a place like wiki who require essentially people having a great sens of honnor, democratie, equality, common sens, and who value ethic.\nThat rules you out, as action speak louder than any words could ever do.\n\nI do not salute you.\nSophie

The issue is when someone, like Carly Fiorina, decides to run for a Senate seat, in a contest already projected to be the most expensive in the upcoming elections, we end up getting caught with our pants down here at Wikipedia because we just don't have effective and thorough procedures surrounding wp:blp in place.

Is there a hierarchal structure system among Administrators so one can overrule another without discussion?\n\nOne image showed the subject of the article wearing the gag ""Fear of the Truth"" over his mouth as he was beat up and removed from the Visitors Gallery of the Canadian House of Commons on the first day of televised debate in history. That would make it an image associated with history, in Canada at least.\n\nUnderstanding WikipediA respects copyrite restrictions, the tag applied to the deleted images reads as follows:\n\nBecause the image is historically significant, the entire image is needed to identify the subject, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image. Low resolution?\n\nThe copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable for uses that would compete with any commercial purpose of the photograph. Purpose of use\n\nIdentification and critical commentary in the article, a subject of public interest. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed next to the associated material discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Replaceable?\n\nBecause the image depicts a non-reproducible historic event, there is almost certainly no free equivalent. Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended, would tarnish or misrepresent its image, or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary. Other information Use of the historic image in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above. The image meets general Wikipedia content requirements and is encyclopaedic.\n\nIt will take some time before the Article is so widely known by the public, there is a 0% probability any newspaper will want to claim copyvio considering the subject.\n\nWill you please undo what you did until there is a free and fair discussion by users? If there is any tag that could be associated to the disputed images to stimulate discussion, do that. The Editors of the Ottawa Citizen have been aware of its images on the Article since they were posted by Earl Andrew.\n\nDoDaCanaDa (talk) \n\n    You should probably address this to User:East718, as he's the one who deleted the images.

However, when I do, it is understood that such references and info be added to the article and re-edited at all. Fair is fair. As a result, I have informed the author about this, but he has taken a hostile attitude towards me and upon the subject, which I reminded him, is against wiki's terms of use. He is adament about not admitting or adding new info despite the info reflecting solid references. Again, this is clearly a breach of wiki's policy and should be reported nontheless in the event of such non-compliance on the part of the author.
__label__non_toxic Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright\nHi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.\n\nI was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.

__label__non_toxic "\n\n Thanks for your reply. You're right that it's common, but it's still wrong according to the Manual of Style. Links should only be included if they're useful to the user: too many links are distracting. It's not useful to link every possible word when there's no doubt about its meaning. So, to take a cricket example, if you write ""He played his first Test match in 1928"", it's useful to link ""Test match"" because people might not know what a Test match is and might want to follow the link to look it up. But it's not useful to link 1928 because everyone knows when 1928 was, so the link doesn't help anyone.\n\n But you don't have to take my word for it. This is explained in detail in Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context and Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links).\n\n Thanks,  "

__label__non_toxic "== Categories related to the National Audio Theatre Festivals page ==\n\nIt is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and ""artists collective"".  \n\nThe festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a ""collective"" or amorphous ""group"" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the ""cherry on the sundae"". \n\nIt is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an ""audio drama festival"". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.\n\nSeveral of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as ""Audio plays"", ""radio drama"", ""sound recording,"" ""sound technology"", and ""voice acting"", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories.

Obviously, that is a decision to be made by the appropriate legal authorities.  Given that I do not wish to be complicit in what is apparently an illegal activity, I am ending my contributions to this site.  It is my hope that this encyclopedia will be a resource for our children as well as ourselves.\n\nI would very much like to continue to participate, and I certainly recognize the impossibility of immediately censoring any article which breaks a law anywhere.  At the same time, reviewing your policy pages it appears that a very few people are responsible for this behavior, and that no coherent policy is in force.  Additionally, given the size of the effort, it is difficult for me to appreciate that the word ""consensus"", which appears quite often, is being used appropriately.\n\nWhile I obviously worry for my children's welfare and upbringing, I am more concerned, at this juncture, in being involved in an activity with appears to be illegal (to whit, a class 3 felony in the state of Florida).\n\nI understand your policies on censorship.  At the same time, most pornography web sites carry disclaimers regarding ""you must be 18 years or older to enter, click here to so state"".  Given that there is no such disclaimer, and that the inclusion would harm the effectiveness of this site, I am at a loss for how you should proceed.\n\nI have, on my user page, outlined the various agencies to whose attention I would like to bring this matter to, and offer you, as Chairman of the Wikifoundation, the opportunity to discuss this with me before I take these actions.  I am quite sure that the majority of members have no interest in participating in an activity which would appear to be other that what it is:  an encyclopedia.\n\nMy best wishes for yourself and your family.\n\n Xchanter"

""Claiming"" is far less neutral than ""stating."" You are arguing the article was biased. I was rectifying that situation. None of which prohibits another party with knowledge of the issues in question from stating the opposite  as Cobra's attorneys have done.

__label__non_toxic "\n\n I heard you like hamburgers. \n\n  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.\n\nHistory\nDespite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said ""Lone Jogger"". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.\n\nHe was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar ""robble robble."" In ""The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and ""The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.\nHamburglar 2015\nIn 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   "

I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).\n\nI understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).  \n\nHowever, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?\n\nI'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.\n\nThanks in advance for filling me in.\n\n \n\nThanks for the help, Grutness (at User_talk:JohnPomeranz)\n\n \n\n Politician-stubs monitoring \n\nHi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.  (talk) \n\nThanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations. My main motivation is to see a consistent system for both the geo-stubs, the politician-stubs, and any other type of stub. So if the ge

__label__non_toxic Born John Webb, John Silas Wilson A.K.A. “BIG HITZ” was born in Chicago Illinois along with eight siblings. Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S. Uwitonze'Bold text'

__label__non_toxic Apologies \n\nI must apologize for the edited page about 'Stockbridge Hampshire' but as i know the village well and looked up the history on wikipedia and found the article more than a little amusing, and thought that some people with a ==sense of humour== would enjoy for about a day, i thought i would share the article. So i'm quietly impressed that there are people like yourself that correct such 'vandalism' so quickly and i'm astonished that somebody had so much spare time to create such an article. But as it has clearly caused offence with yourself and your clearly 'religious' friends i must apologize.
__label__non_toxic "\n\n Choosing an easement curve \n\nI'd like to be clear about:\n(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...\n(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)\n\nMy main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):\nThere are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.\nThis reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: ""the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"", along with various practical approximations to them.\n\nThe article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.\n\nI'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?\n\n  "

__label__non_toxic Ohhhh! I know what your talking about now, that little dark spot in the photographs. Oh man, this is toooooo funny. Time for a justified rare instance of l33t speak on wikipedia: ROFLMAO!!! \nregain compusure* K, let me explain.\nI'll start with the basics: spacecraft are very expensive. They can only send a few out of earth orbit (where they have no ability to generate income like earth sattelite spacecraft) every so often. For various reasons they place the few spacecraft that can be afforded in equatorial orbitsmainly because they can't afford to send out 1 spacecraft for each planet, so they have to keep the sattelite orbiting in the solar plain so it can be sent to another planet later. From equatorial orbits there is only one way to take a picture of the polesfrom the side! Even though the picture looks like it is one shot from the top, it is actually several shots from the side and put together to make it look like its one shot from the top. In order to make it look like its taken from the top, they have to correct for the fact that its actually taken from the side. The very top just becomes a gross stretched out mess. \nYou probably don't notice, but there is a pattern here of seeing fantastic explanations where there is a simple explanation. Its a certain type of thinking that tends to make people prone to conspiracy theories.

__label__non_toxic Your username \n\nSorry if you've had to answer this a thousand times, but why are you using two accounts in this manner?  For one, redirecting your user talk page breaks some scripts that try to leave you xFD notifications and the like so it can result in messages getting left on the wrong talk page, but being invisible because that page is still a link.  But more than that, if you are going to be exercising your administrative tools, you really need to pick one account and use it for transparency.  If you are trying to work around SUL (ie, if Al Tally is your SUL name, but Majorly is your preferred identity here), there is another way around it - you can use the Wikimedia secure server here and the regular server everywhere else (or vice versa).  They have two separate sets of credentials and that's what I do.  Someone else has User:B on Commons, so I use User:UserB there and I simply use the https: URLs for commons and the http: URLs for Wikipedia.

__label__non_toxic "\n\n Jesus article too long \n\nRecently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  ""this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"" Doc glasgow\n\nThe problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have ""quotes"" sections.\n\nIf the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a ""Other topics about Jesus"" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.\n\nI propose that we condense these topics:\n\n1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)\n2. Background\n3. Names and titles\n4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics\n5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals\n\nAnd then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.\n\nAlso, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.\n\nThis should substantially reduce these sections:\n1. Notes\n2. Sources and further reading\n3. See also\n4. External links\n\nAfter this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.\n\nWhat do you all think?"
